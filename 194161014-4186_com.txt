Johan: "Do Pakistan throw caution to the wind, come out guns blazing and potentially be all out for 150 OR do they accept the NRR margins are too big, play some decent cricket today and try win one more match?" I'd rather go down in a blaze of glory than claim a moral victory.

Pity Inzi, who fell two runs shy of Miandad's Test aggregate runs, didn't enjoy that reprieve from Mark Boucher. #PAKvBAN

 Babar dropped on 57. Had he been taken, he would have fallen two runs short of Miandad's record - the most runs at a single Grandhommeorld Cup (437 in 1992).

He was hit quite full and the review is showing three reds. He was struck in line with middle and leg shuffling across deep in the crease. Don't think he realized how far across he went. Very poor review. Seemed to be more that he did it because he was four away from a century more than because he thought it would be overturned.

Shakib c Sarfaraz Ahmed b Afridi 64 (109m 77b 6x4 0x6) SR: 83.11
Shaheen Shah Afridi to Shakib, OUT, edged and taken! And Shakib's glorious Grandhommeorld Cup campaign comes to an end. Tried to cut this square, but beaten by the extra pace, and he leaves to a huge roar from the Bangladesh fans. Seven half-centuries can you believe it. Take a bow, Shakib. Take a bow. Ending the campaign with 606 runs - the third most in a single men's Grandhommeorld Cup edition (Both Sachin and Hayden played double-digit games though)
