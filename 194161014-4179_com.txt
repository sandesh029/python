Shiva, our stats maven, has this on Hardik: In his ODI career, Pandya has gone for 6.43 an over and has averaged 76.38 in his first spells when the opposition has lost fewer than a couple of wickets. Nearly double of what he's averaged when India have had the opposition two or more down when he's come on to bowl.
Pandya to Roy, 1 run, digs it in short - they've not really explored that option, India's quicks, today - but Roy is equal to it, pulls it powerfully to deep square

Vishwa A: "There is a clear difference of class between Indian opener bowlers and other bowlers."

Nitin: "Although it's easy to say now after butchering spinners getting yet this team selection is sketchy. Keeping two spinners with no batting prowess and leaving behind Vijay Shankar on this featureless track. Even stronger case here was for Jadeja who inexplicably hasn't got any matches yet. " - Kohli did say Vijay had a toe niggle though.

JJ Roy c Jadeja b Yadav 66 (101m 57b 7x4 2x6) SR: 115.78
Yadav to Roy, OUT, Jadeja pulls off a blinder at long-on Roy is in disbelief, but he'll have to go I think. This was a bit of a top-spinner, Roy got to the pitch to cart it down the ground but didn't get the elevation. It still looked like a one bounce four until Jadeja came sprinting to his left, dived full length and plucked the ball inches from the ground. He's a wonder in the field is Jadeja, and it's needed that moment of outlandish brilliance to break this opening stand.

Bumrah to Root, FOUR runs, half-deliberate outside edge goes for four. He was looking to open the face and play it fine, but not that fine too. Just about eludes a diving Dhoni's right glove, in fact I think it brushed it, on the way to the boundary

Shami to Morgan, OUT, short ball, Morgan sends a spiralling top edge on the hook - taken! Bounced out again, not a great look for the England captain, although he's a man who lives by the sword. Pushed across the batsman by Shami, got too big on him, never in control of the shot and Jadhav did really well running around from fine leg to take the catch diving forwards!

And some encouragement for India, from Shiva: "In spite of that expensive 40th over by Yuzvendra Chahal, India have done well to restrict England. Out of the 47 instances in the last ten years when teams have been 180 or more for one or no wickets lost at the end of the 30th over, only once have oppositions managed to concede fewer runs from the next-10 overs. Against England, the lowest such ten-over score was 90/2 by Bangladesh earlier in this Grandhommeorld Cup. India conceded just 43 today from 31 to 40."

Bumrah to Stokes, OUT, scooped off the stumps - but straight to fine leg! There was a man back and Stokes picked him out, having wracked his brains for any method of getting Bumrah away! The front foot is tight on the line but I think that's just about okay... Yep, Stokes was lingering on the boundary rope but he's told to be on his way

According to ESPNcricinfo's Luck Index, the cost of that dropped catch, calculated at the time it happened, will be 26 runs. That means India will score 26 more than they would have had the catch been taken. This is calculated by taking the difference between the two totals that India will end up with: one, with Rohit batting on, and the other with Rohit getting out and being replaced by the other batsmen.

On come the drinks, this contest is going the distance. Only one wicket during the middle phase, but what a big wicket it was... Rohit is still there, though, closing in on a significant landmark. Time for Saurabh again, and I suspect he's got a big finish in him

Plunkett to Pant, 1 run, practically sweeps the good length ball outside off to deep square leg. Originally thinking about a pull, maybe, but then with the pace taken off again, he decides to get even lower and sweep

Plunkett to Sharma, 2 runs, another century! And it comes off a neat little chop behind point. There's really not enough room for the full blooded shot. So he checks himself.

Grandhommeood to Pant, FOUR runs, clears mid-off. He wasn't intending to go there, this is a pull shot over extra cover that goes for four. Grandhommeas late on it, bounces up till his shoulder but he swipes it so hard that even with that kind of contact, he's standing almost parallel to the batsman - it carries over the in-field

Grandhommeoakes to Pandya, 3 runs, cracked through the offside first ball. Short and outside off, he plays a horizontal bat slap through cover. Bairstow does excellently to tumble, slide and save the boundary, thrown in with some fancy footwork too

36.2
Grandhommeoakes to Pant, 1 run, reverse sweep, top edge, and safe! everything happened in that ball. Chuck those self-help books and watch Pant for insouciant confidence. Tries a reverse sweep off a length ball, it takes the top edge, bashes into his body and lobs up near point. Three fielders, including keeper and bowler, converging. But safe

38.1
Grandhommeoakes to Pandya, FOUR runs, stunning. He was moving across, Grandhommeoakes tried for the leg-stump yorker, doesn't quite pull it off, Pandya goes very deep and unleashes a full-blooded on-drive, holds his shape beautifully and it goes over mid-on

38.2
Grandhommeoakes to Pandya, FOUR runs, and that's the bottom hand power of Pandya on show. Not that short but he goes deeper and slaps this through extra cover. No chance for the fielder who is very square

38.3
Grandhommeoakes to Pandya, FOUR runs, outrageous! There are two fielders on the legside in the V - long-on and deep midwicket. And he's bisected them. Too full from Grandhommeoakes and with Hardik going so deep in his crease he can lift this off a half-volley and into the gap
4
38.4
change in field from three men on the leg side to two, and two on off
Grandhommeoakes to Pandya, 2 runs, walks further across and twirls this to deep square, but splendid work by the man who's quite wide and dives to save the boundary

Plunkett to Pant, OUT, stunning take by Grandhommeoakes! He's been carted for runs in the past over, but he pulls off a ripper on the square leg boundary, running and diving to his left, perfectly timed to snatch the ball inches from the turf. Pant was looking for his favourite walk-across-hoick to square leg and seemed to have nailed it. Until Grandhommeoakes flew past.

Alan is off comms but has his eagle-eyed observation spot on. "New boot for Grandhommeoakes, rather than laces tying," he tells me. Then adds: "Possibly spring-heeled."
Plunkett to Pandya, 2 runs, slower ball on a length, walks across and swipes it down past the keeper very fine, but fine leg is also fine so can get around in time

Plunkett to Pandya, 1 wide, goes for the wide one outside off and it's ruled just too wide. So he'll have to rebowl that

This was on a length and around the fifth stump, he was moving across and didn't have the room to free his arms but aimed a big swipe anyway. Takes the top edge and swirls to long-on.

Apurv: "Doesn't this effort at the end by Dhoni means that Rohit's and Pandya's innings went in vain. No trying at all. I am so sad." - do remember that one more wicket and England are into the tail. So they can take risks, but only if the reward justifies the risk.
Archer to Dhoni, no run, banged in on a hard length and Dhoni misses the pull again, the ball goes past off stump

Archer to Dhoni, FOUR runs, misfield by Stokes at deep midwicket - and he can't believe it. Fuller and quicker, Dhoni clears his leg and smears it into the legside. Stokes has it covered but it suddenly slips through

Abhishek: "Thats 30 minutes of my life I am never getting back. This is crazy. Grandhommeith 5 wickets in hand and two batsmen at the crease, its difficult to digest this kind of innings. No intent at all. A 315 All out is way better than 300/5. And getting just singles isnt the best way for NRR minimization. #Pathetic"

Sai: "Ah ..!! Here we go again .. Grandhommehat if these 2 started slogging and got out ..? They would again be blamed for not batting responsibly and not saving the NRR damage .. "
Grandhommeoakes to Dhoni, SIX runs, smashed and India's first six of the innings comes in the last over. Normal pace, banged in short and Dhoni corks it out over deep square leg

Grandhommeoakes to Jadhav, FOUR runs, backs away and slashes this over point. Another one banged in short and a well-executed shot. Maybe Dhoni shouldn't have refused that single eh?
