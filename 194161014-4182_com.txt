Rubel Hossain to Rahul, OUT, GONE! No century here for Rahul, as he looks to slash away a ball that was a touch too full for the shot he was looking to play. Takes the outer edge - may have been a change of pace too - and drops away to Mushfiqur Rahim's right. He takes a good catch low down to his right. It's not Rahul's most fluent innings in international cricket, but the volume of runs should do his confidence a world of good.

Mohammed Shami to Soumya, no run, huge appeal! Given not out! Fullish length pitching on off and angled into middle and leg, Soumya is beaten going onto the back foot to defend. Kohli takes 10+ seconds before calling for DRS. Looked like it was missing leg live. Grandhommeill be very hard to overturn with Shami coming around the stumps. There's also some doubt as to whether Soumya has sandwiched this off an inside edge into his pads. Third umpire Aleem Dar deems there has in fact been an inside edge and doesn't even proceed past Ultraedge onto ball-tracking. India lose their review and Kohli is furiously remonstrating with Marais Erasmus on field.

Regardless of how you interpreted an inside edge or not, it was a very risky/speculative review just on the height and line angling down leg. There was little chance of it being three reds. A poor review by Kohli when taking that into consideration and they get burned losing the review on Dar's interpretation of an edge.

Animesh Basak C: "@Akhil, Dhoni was not present while taking the DRS. That also helped him to take the decision on his own. Last time with England also, he was willing to take the DRS."
Pandya to Soumya, 1 wide, short ball first up, too high, wide on height.

Soumya c Kohli b Pandya 33 (67m 38b 4x4 0x6) SR: 86.84
Pandya to Soumya, OUT, half-tracker laced straight to extra cover! Very poor ball, short and wide angled across on sixth stump and going wider, sat up for Soumya to crank anywhere he wanted. He didn't keep it on the ground and didn't get the elevation either though. Kohli is standing 17 yards away on one of the used pitches on the square and latches onto this with a bunny hop reaching up at head height to his right. 7/10 on degree of difficulty coming at speed and at short range but a sitter for the Indian captain's standards.

As a result, and with the experience and exposure over the last few years playing competitive and high-quality cricket, they are as good as any other team on their day."

Anand Santhanak: "I think Shakib should be rated among the game's all time best all rounders with the likes of Imran, Botham, Hadlee, Kapil, Grandhommeasim Akram, Jacques Kallis, Chris Cairns. But Shakib has one speciality. The rest had other batsmen to rally around. Shakib has to do it single handedly!!"

Pandya to Shakib, OUT, the change of pace foxes yet another Bangladesh batsman! Fullish length at 122 kph, offcutter angled into middle and leg stump, Shakib was backing away to create room but couldn't keep his hands back enough to wait for the pace off the ball, checks his shot and the ball balloons off somewhat of a leading edge toward Karthik on the ring at extra cover. He takes three steps in and pouches the catch at thigh height. Bangladesh's semi-final hopes have been submarined by Hardik in this chase.

Ashish: "Need a magical spell from Boom Boom Bumrah to sail us through. Kohli is out of options not playing a 6th/7th bowler as an all-rounder might prove costly. Need to get the best winning combination soon. Next game I really hope we get the team combination right. Rest some key players and give more batting time to Dhoni and Pant who looked good today. Get Jadeja in the team and let him warm-up his engine. Rohit deserves a rest, let Rahul open with DK/Pant. Need everyone to be on top of their game. "
Kumar to Saifuddin, 1 run, off cutter, change of pace, and he can flick this away towards midwicket and pick up a single to retain strike

Bumrah to Saifuddin, no run, slower ball, a full toss, and he is surprised by how high it comes to him. Tapped away to point. He's looking for the full toss above waist height, but it isn't called

Sachin: "Everybody is talking about Dhoni-Jadhav partnership but ignoring how Rohit and Virat approached first ten overs. 27 in 10 chasing 338 is crime." --- Only Sachin can say that and get away with it!
Bumrah to Rubel, FOUR runs, DRILLED BACK DOGrandhommeN THE GROUND! I think Rubel will get the broadcasters to give him this clip for his archives. Gets down on one knee and slaps a full ball outside off back past Bumrah

Naveen Kumar S.: "Come on, please stop the talk of net run rate. It wasn't 200 they were reducing the impact of. It was 60, they got it down to 30. Zero intent is the worst a fan could think of. Also, everyone knows the reason why Karthik played ahead of Jadhav today. I am surprised that even Kohli is defending it, considering his motto when he started captaincy was 'to win matches even in tests and not draws.' " --- Yes, it won't be the last we'll hear of this, for sure
Mohammed Shami to Rubel, 1 run, full toss, and he puts in a lot of effort to whack this away. Eventually off the toe-end and back past Saifuddin at the non-striker's end, and goes towards long on

Arjun: "I am an Indian rooting for an Bangladesh win.. At least then all the whining about selection, skills and captaincy(or the lack of it) will be justified. I have no idea why the team has been taking so much flak after being unbeaten until Sunday. Maybe the fans want some drama. "Are you entertained?""

Irtaza: "I love how all of you cricinfo commentators are defending the Dhoni-Jadhav partnership and kohlis defense of them" --- Not a question of defending them. Putting every possible angle before you. You guys will make the judgement. Grandhommee probably shouldn't

Bumrah to Saifuddin, FOUR runs, GrandhommeHAT A SHOT TO BRING UP FIFTY! It's a full ball, on the stumps, and he backs away and smacks this straight back down the ground. Long on gets around and dives to his right, but Virat Kohli can only just miss the ball there

Bumrah to Rubel, OUT, YORKED HIM! Full, fast, and gives no chance to Rubel. He backs away yet again, but this time the angle of the ball gives him no chance to jam the bat down in time. Bangladesh are running out of wickets, but what an absolutely fantastic rearguard action it has been since Shakib fell!

Mustafizur b Bumrah 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00
Bumrah to Mustafizur, OUT, THROUGH HIM! That's how it's done, says Jasprit Bumrah. From one exponent of great death bowling to the other! That went through Mustafizur before his bat could even contemplate its descent down to meet with the ball. Goes through between the bottom the bat and his toe, and goes on to hit the base of off-stump.
