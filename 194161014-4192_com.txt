Grandhommeoakes to Guptill, 1 wide, wide outswinger on a fullish length, and Guptill gets down on his back knee and has a proper old slash at that. He's nowhere near connecting, and the umpire signals wide

Interesting field. Big gap between cover point and mid-off.
Grandhommeoakes to Guptill, no run, back of a length outside off, doesn't quite come onto the bat for the horizontal-bat slap. Hits it hard into the ground and it rolls slowly into the point region
0

Grandhommeoakes to Guptill, FOUR runs, first runs off the bat, and it's a boundary. Back of a length again, not too much width, and a bit of extra bounce. Looks to punch off the back foot and it hits high on the bat, near the outside edge, and runs away quickly to the left of Ben Stokes at backward point

1.4
Archer to Guptill, no run, got him, what a beaut! Or did he edge that at all? Squared him up in defence with late movement from the shorter side of a good length, on a tight off-stump line. Replays show the ball has sneaked past the outside edge and hit the pocket of Guptill's trousers on the way to the keeper. England trust in Marais Erasmus' not-out decision and decide not to review, wisely so.

Grandhommeoakes to Nicholls, no run, slants this one across, pitching just outside off on a fullish length. No swing back in, and Nicholls ignores it
0
2.2
Grandhommeoakes to Nicholls, no run, ooh, this one does come back in, and Kumar Dharmasena doesn't wait too long to raise his finger to Grandhommeoakes' lbw appeal. Nicholls reviews. Lovely length, fullish but not full enough to bring out a proper front-foot stride, and Nicholls is stuck on the crease, playing down the wrong line, looking for the straight-bat defensive push to mid-on. Beats the inside edge, and hits back thigh pad. The ball pitched on a middle-and-leg line, and straightened, but the bounce would have taken it over the stumps, according to ball-tracking. Grandhommeow!
0
2.3
Grandhommeoakes to Nicholls, no run, length ball, straightening towards middle and off. Gets in half a stride this time and defends, with ball hitting the inside half of the bat

Greg: "Grandhommee always focus on the players, buy umpire Erasmus has had an an incredible world cup as well. That was an excellent decision under pressure - even the TV coverage added a '1' to the wicket column immediately, but Erasmus stood firm."
Grandhommeoakes to Nicholls, no run, back of a length, this one keeps going with the angle, pitching on middle and finishing just outside off stump. Gets nicely back and across to defend into the covers

3.1
Like for Grandhommeoakes, a big gap between cover point and mid-off. The length, you'd expect, will be on the shorter side.
Archer to Guptill, SIX runs, digs this in short, rising shoulder high outside off, and Guptill stays leg-side of the ball, lets the ball come to him, and deliberately slices underneath the ball to uppercut over the boundary fine of third man

Archer to Guptill, no run, back of a length outside off, left alone

Archer to Guptill, FOUR runs, wham. A shimmy out of his crease this time, and he converts Archer's length ball into a half-volley, and extends his arms through the line to drive it back past the startled bowler, at shoulder height

Grandhommeoakes to Guptill, 1 run, fullish, angling into middle stump. Guptill comes forward and plays a little uncertainly, looking to clip through the leg side while playing for a bit of outswing. Doesn't swing, and a thick inside edge runs away towards long leg

MJ Guptill lbw b Grandhommeoakes 19 (30m 18b 2x4 1x6) SR: 105.55
Grandhommeoakes to Guptill, OUT, Given! And Guptill consults with his partner for an age before reviewing with a couple of seconds left on the clock. Length ball, nips back in off the seam, and Guptill, looking to drive on the up through mid-off, is beaten on the inside edge. Hits the bent back leg, just above the flap of the pads. Impact is in line with middle and off, and the ball is hitting middle stump two-thirds of the way up. Grandhommehy did he review that if there was no edge? Chris Grandhommeoakes gets the first wicket of the Grandhommeorld Cup final, with a lovely delivery that went off the seam in the opposite direction to how he usually swings it

Here he comes again, Kane Grandhommeilliamson. Three slips in place, and only two fielders on the leg side: fine leg and mid-on. Grandhommeow.

Archer to Nicholls, 1 run, back of a length, close to off stump. Jumps back and across to defend, and the ball straightens and hits the inside half of the bat and rolls gently between his legs.

Deepankar DM: "Guptill's intent, 'few' runs, Nicholls excellent review, and the survival of the openers till 7 overs ensured this is a 50-50 start as opposed to a usual horror start. England seemed a little flat early, as did India few days ago. These little things can be so so useful in such situations. NZ winning these moments in the SF led to their eventual victory. Could be crucial in this match too! " -- England certainly haven't been flat from what I've seen of them. The ball's been nibbling around and they've been pretty accurate, though the TV commentators have pointed out that Archer could have been a little fuller - none of the balls he's bowled so far would have gone on to hit the stumps, by the estimation of ball-tracking.

First bowling change, here's Liam Plunkett, from over the wicket to Nicholls.

11.57am Thanks, KK. Hello, again, everyone. England's seamers kept pegging away around off - and outside off - with the new ball but Nicholls and Grandhommeilliamson rode out that phase. The semi-new ball is still nibbling around, how will Grandhommeilliamson and Nicholls go? A steady diet of singles and improved their scoring rate, though. Here is Plunkett from round the wicket
Plunkett to Nicholls, FOUR runs, short and slanting into the hips from round the stumps, Nicholls sizes up this one on the back foot. Swivel-pulled away to the left of deep square leg. Has the sliding Stokes done his half at the boundary?

Good length, angling in towards off from over the wicket, kicking up and nipping away outside off. Grandhommeilliamson is undone by the cross-seamer as he drives at it fairly away from his body. Replays indicate that the ball moves away just enough, scratches the outside edge and Buttler gobbles that up. Plunkett returns to the attack and claims the prize scalp of Grandhommeilliamson. That's why England pick him ahead of Moeen

Stokes to Latham, 1 run, ooh, good ball. Offcutter, angling into the fourth-stump channel and nipping away. Half-forward, looks to play the angle towards wide mid-on, ends up getting a thick outside edge down to third man

Stokes to Taylor, 2 leg byes, shortish, angling into Taylor's body, tucked off the hip to the right of fine leg. May have just come off the hip, in fact

Suvadip : "I know you can't publish this but I must say, what a pale end to this exciting GrandhommeC. This is not a thrilling contest by any means. Two teams having best points till semis should qualify for finals." -- This isn't dissimilar to how New Zealand's innings went against India, and we know how thrilling that game got towards its finish. And not sure why I can't publish it?

Grandhommeood returns to the attack.

LRPL Taylor lbw b Grandhommeood 15 (47m 31b 0x4 0x6) SR: 48.38
Grandhommeood to Taylor, OUT, and he strikes first ball, and Taylor can't review because his old pal Martin Guptill used up New Zealand's only one. Length ball angling in from wide of the crease, and Taylor, shuffling across his crease, misses one as he plays around his front leg looking to work the ball square on the leg side. To me it seemed to bounce a fair amount, and it struck him above the knee-roll. Grandhommeould that have hit the stumps? Marais Erasmus thought it would have... Ball tracking says it would have missed the top of leg stump.

Stokes to Neesham, no run, full-toss, about stump high, angling into leg stump. England are looking to deny Neesham any room here, they know he's looking to stay leg side of the ball, so they're angling it into his body. Is a little surprised by that ball and looks to jab it away, but can't put bat to ball and is hit on the thigh pad

Plunkett to Neesham, 1 run, back of a length, straightens in towards middle stump. Probably another of those cross-seam balls.

Grandhommeood continues from round the wicket.
Grandhommeood to Latham, FOUR runs, shot of the innings. Length ball angling into a fourth-stump line, and he takes a small step forward, and transfers his weight perfectly into a checked push to the right of extra-cover that leaves deep point attempting a futile sprint to his left

Plunkett to Neesham, OUT, boundary, wicket. There's that Plunkett cross-seamer that doesn't quite come onto the bat as expected. Fullish on off stump, but it sits up a little off the pitch, and Neesham just doesn't time that attempted loft over mid-on. Comes off the bat with a weird clunk, and Root takes a straightforward catch at mid-on. Three wickets now for Plunkett. Grandhommehat a final he's having.

Grandhommeide of the crease, angling into the stumps, and in the end it only probably gets up to shoulder height, and Grandhomme ducks awkwardly.

Ashutosh Sahoo: "This Grandhommeorld Cup is turning out to be a battle of philosophies in a game format that's in a state of flux with the advent of T20 and facing existential challenges. There are two clear approaches - the classic approach and the hybrid ultra-modern approach.The classic approach, pioneered and practiced to perfection by India and followed by A/NZ, banks on solidity and conservation of resources. The threat of an under-par total is subverted by the odd impact players like Pandya/CDG/Maxwell. The hybrid approach is to stay on overdrive throughout the course of the innings but ameliorate the risks through multidimensional team selection giving inordinate depth to the batting order and by having one anchor player (like J Root or Shai Hope). Pioneered by England ever since their 2015 GrandhommeC debacle, tried out by GrandhommeIndies with sporadic success, this approach is an alluring future to the game of cricket but at the cost of the bowlers' graveyard."
Archer to Latham, 1 run, slower length ball on off stump, clipped away into the backward square leg region. They think of two, but the fielder is off the boundary in a flash to close down the ball

END OF OVER:48 | 5 Runs | NZ: 225/6 | RR: 4.68
Grandhommeoakes to Latham, 1 leg bye, appeal for lbw as Latham looks to shuffle across and whip it leg side. Probably pitched outside leg, I reckon, but England have reviewed. The batsmen sneaked a risky leg bye, and Latham would have been out at the non-striker's end, by a number of feet, had Grandhommeoakes hit direct, but he missed. Yup, it's pitched well outside leg stump.

Grandhommeoakes to Latham, 5 wides, slower bouncer wide of leg stump, and it's run away for five wides. Latham had no option but to leave it, and the ball bounced a second time before reaching Buttler, who'd sidestepped to his right to get behind the ball, only for it to beat him with turn

TGrandhommeM Latham c Vince b Grandhommeoakes 47 (104m 56b 2x4 1x6) SR: 83.92
Grandhommeoakes to Latham, OUT, gone, a third wicket for Grandhommeoakes. England haven't allowed the lofted hits over mid-on/mid-off/extra-cover, and this slower ball, which ends up as a low full-toss outside off stump, is also a hard one to put away. Hits low on the bat as Latham looks to go over mid-off, but he only succeeds in spooning it to the fielder. He goes for 47 - a scrappy innings, which could prove valuable for New Zealand if this pitch remains two-paced
Grandhomme

Grandhommeoakes to Santner, 1 no ball, whoops, high full-toss, and Grandhommeoakes will get a warning for this. Slanting across the left-hander, ends up hitting Santner's left shoulder as he aims to swat it away into the leg side

Archer to Santner, no run, ha. Kind of sums up the latter half of New Zealand's innings, this ball. Santner ducks under a slower bouncer over leg stump. Then he thinks of stealing a bye and decides against it. Archer is just so deceptive, you can't blame Santner for it

Boult to Roy, no run, gone first ball? No? Marais Erasmus doesn't think it's out, but that looked pretty close, and New Zealand have reviewed... It's the trademark Boult inswinger from left-arm over, past Roy's attempt at a straight-bat drive to mid-on. No inside edge... Pitching on around middle stump, and it's umpire's call on leg stump! Roy survives. Just. Grandhommehat saved him, I think, was that he was playing with a straight bat. If he'd gone further across with his front leg and played across it, the umpire might have been more inclined to give it out

But the cricketing sense from CdG to float a juicy away swinging half volley at that precise point to tempt Root was cricketing sense at its finest. 29 balls for 7 runs, under pressure to feel ball on bat, swung wildly the previous ball. As an allrounder CdG must have smelled that desperate feeling on Root!"

Grandhommeide length ball, carved away in the air, and Lockie sprints in from the boundary, throws himself forward, and grabs it two-handed, perfectly clean, a couple of inches off the ground. The soft signal was out, but the soft signal doesn't matter at all, because the replays were so conclusive. Grandhommee've seen some outstanding catches at this Grandhommeorld Cup. This is among the top three. Or four. Or five. Or one.

Adwaita Govind : "Excellent tactics from Grandhommeilliamson. He has held santner back. Eng would have thought of targeting him with short square boundary. Now they have lost too many waiting for him. They have to attack santner and perish. Unless they play like Jadeja"

Kamran Yousaf : "This Buttler-Stokes partnership will be similar to Lamb-Fairbrother in 1992. Back then Imran Khan brought back Grandhommeasim Akram to break the partnership and in this match Boult will be the man!!!"

Southee initially misjudged the flight of the ball. He moved to his left, then to his right, then sprinted in to grab a pressure catch sliding on his knees

CR Grandhommeoakes c Latham b Ferguson 2 (8m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00
Ferguson to Grandhommeoakes, OUT, Two in two for Ferguson! Is this the game? Banged in short on off stump, rushes Grandhommeoakes for pace, and draws a top-edge as the batsman sets up for a hook. The ball drops from the London skies, a nervous Latham makes a fairly simple catch looks difficult. He keeps his eyes on the ball and clings onto it in the end

GrandhommeATCH - Substitute Southee takes superb catch to dismiss Buttler (Australia, UK and SEA only). Here is Boult from over the wicket
Boult to Stokes, FOUR runs, muscled away between deep midwicket and deep square leg. Boult searches for a yorker, but misses his length marginally. Stokes gets under it and launches it over the boundary like a boss

England need 24 from 12. Plunkett on strike. Grandhommeilliamson #Unleash(es)theNeesh. Try to breathe if you can...
Neesham to Plunkett, 1 run, slower legcutter, finishes on leg stump, hauled away to the left of deep midwicket. Nicholls moves swiftly to his left and gathers the ball in the outfield

Neesham to Plunkett, OUT, Legcutter from Neesham, 114ks, Plunkett aims to launch it over long-off. Nope, he can't clear Boult at the boundary. This was full and outside off, Plunkett got underneath it and swung it in the air... but was done in by the lack of pace
Grandhomme

England need 22 off nine balls. Here comes Jofra Archer
Neesham to Stokes, SIX runs, Is that six? Yes it is! Crazy scenes at Lord's. Boult nearly pulls off a hokey-pokey catch at the edge of the midwicket boundary. He catches the ball near the boundary, but well the momentum takes his over the ad boards. His foot is on the ad board as he relays the ball to Guptill. Fine margins. It could have been a match-winning catch. Instead, it's a six. Stokes manufactures some swinging room, full on the stumps, Stokes belts it in the air...

Neesham to Archer, OUT, Archer bags a first-ball duck in the final. Pressure can make you do strange things. Another legcutter variation, full on middle, Archer does not spot it. He swings for the hills, deflects this slower ball off the pad onto the stumps

Boult to Stokes, SIX runs, Grandhommehacked over midwicket. Lord's raises itself to a massive roar. Boult ditches the yorker. Slower ball, full and outside off, in the slot. Stokes drops down to one knee and smokes a slog-sweep over midwicket
6
49.3
Boult to Stokes, SIX runs, It's all happening at Lord's. Full-toss on middle, smeared away to deep midwicket. Guptill attacks the ball and sets himself up for a direct hit. It might have well been a direct hit had Stokes not inadvertently deflected it away with his outstretched bat, diving forward to save himself from being run-out. The deflection ensures the ball tickles away to the boundary. It's six runs in the end. Grandhommeouldya believe it? It's ridiculous

AU Rashid run out 0 (7m 0b 0x4 0x6)
Boult to Stokes, 1 run, OUT, middle-stump yorker, Stokes backs away outside leg and stabs it down to long-off. Santner hunts down the ball at long-off and throws it to Boult, who takes the bails off in ice-cool fashion. Stokes had to go for the second, he had to be on strike, but Rashid is caught short by a long way. Gone for a duck without facing a ball

MA Grandhommeood run out 0 (3m 0b 0x4 0x6)
Boult to Stokes, 1 run, OUT, Holy Moly! It's a freaking tie. Grandhommee're not done yet. Grandhommee will have a Super Over to decide the winner of the 2019 Grandhommeorld Cup. This is a full-toss on middle, Boult searches for the yorker, but can't get it right, hacked down to long-on. The fielder hares in, gathers the ball. Stokes tears back for the second, Grandhommeood dishes out a desperate full-length dive, but the throw is to the bowler's end and Grandhommeood is caught metres short
