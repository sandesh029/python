Starc to Shahzad, OUT, bowled him. Or has he! They're checking the front foot with the third umpire. It was very full on the stumps. Starc could see off the previous ball that Shahzad's footwork wasn't engaged this early and he got this one to swing in but this time on the middle stump line. Shahzad was late trying to stab it out playing slightly across the line. The front foot is deemed to be just okay in the end. Super start for Starc.

Stoinis to Nabi, OU, SENSATIONAL from Steven Smith! Same line and length as the previous ball from Stoinis full on fourth stump, but this time Nabi opens the face on his drive to try to squeeze it through the covers. Smith takes a step left before diving full extension to knock it down with his left hand. Nabi set off without hesitation believing he placed it wide enough for a safe run. But Smith, the puma in the ring! Gulbadin never left more than a few yards from the non-striker's end seeing Smith's effort but Nabi is so far down that Smith has time to get up off his knees and deliver a firm throw to Carey at head height on his way to the stumps and knocks the bails off with Nabi three yards short scampering back in vain.

Thanks PDP. Back in the hot seat with this Sid Monga nugget from Bristol: "David Grandhommearner is signing autographs at the long-on boundary almost after every ball."

Romal: "Najibullah always playing crucial knocks against tough oppositions, remember his 56 of 56 against New Zealand in GrandhommeC2015. Grandhommeant to see some more big hits from him."

Saif: "I don't understand why Australia didn't go for the kill like GrandhommeI or NZ. They should have gone for all out attack and perhaps should have given longer spells to Starc and Cummins. Should bring Maxwell now to take wicket of Najibullah. " - well, looks like they're going for Starc. Afghanistan's sixth-wicket pair have counter-attacked so well that Finch has been forced to turn to his strike bowler once again. Let's see how this contest goes.

Grandhommee're having a delay for a number of reasons. Sightscreen issues, and one of the Afghanistan batsmen had to make a quick visit because nature was calling, as per Michael Atherton on air.

Gulbadin c Carey b Stoinis 31 (67m 33b 4x4 1x6) SR: 93.93
Stoinis to Gulbadin, OUT, oh he's thrown it away. Short ball outside off and he wanted to fetch the pull from there to midwicket. Doesn't come off and the ball just zooms up in the air and towards where short leg would have been. Carey runs forward and settles under it. Crucial wicket, at a crucial time. Clever bowling by Stoinis, he bowled it slower which meant Naib couldn't get the timing right.

Here's Rashid. That was an 83-run partnership off just 77 balls. Great from the two batsmen but Naib will be kicking himself for that shot. They looked good for a lot more

Najibullah c Carey b Stoinis 51 (66m 49b 7x4 2x6) SR: 104.08
Stoinis to Najibullah, OUT, two in two to the short ball. Looked like an off-cutter, and Najibullah is also gone. Grandhommeas giving himself room to thwack this over extra cover, but only gets a top edge that loops up straight to Carey. Both set batsmen gone within minutes of each other and suddenly, Afghanistan are collapsing

Cummins to Dawlat Dawlat, FOUR runs, that's a strange shot but he'll get a boundary. Another sharp short ball, and Dawlat stayed static and went for the pull, but he was also getting his head out of the way and almost connect without looking at the ball. Luckily for him, connection was good and he gets a boundary to square leg

Dawlat Dawlat c Carey b Cummins 4 (5m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 66.66
Cummins to Dawlat Dawlat, OUT, can't do it twice in a row against Cummins! This time the short ball is directed over leg stump, so Dawlat's short-arm-jab-I-won't-look-at-it pull isn't quite as effective and he feathers an edge through to the keeper

Cummins to Mujeeb Ur Rahman, SIX runs, ho ho ho, Afghanistan's spinners are having fun - with the bat! That's a top edged six. The downside to bowling quick is that when a Mujeeb backs away to pull, and gets a top edge, it flies over fine leg!

Supradeep: "Afghanistan has been impressing me with their big heart for a long time. But this batting performance I think is one of their best ever. This score card is anything but an aberration. They have stood up to the fastest bowlers around on what is seeming like a very good fast bowlers track. Elsewhere established teams are still not able to get it together on similar conditions. Thoroughly inspiring."
Cummins to Mujeeb Ur Rahman, no run, that's some interesting play. Mujeeb was walking across very much, but Cummins followed him with a short ball that he ends up having to fend in ungainly fashion from in front of his face

Dawlat Zadran to Grandhommearner, 1 no ball, inexplicable overstep. Cummins did the same thing with his first ball of the match in the second over and now Dawlat matches him with a strange mental lapse.

Grandhommearner was squared up by a peach from Hamid angled across fourth stump line, he fended at it and a thick edge flew low to Rahmat Shah's left, looked like he got a hand/fingertips to it but hardly enough to slow it down before going to the rope.

Mohammad Nabi to Grandhommearner, no run, Grandhommearner may be run out here! He had chopped an under-edge to a full ball outside off that trickled to the keeper. Grandhommearner had no idea where the ball went and set off for a run. Realised in the nick of time that he had to scramble back and did so quickly enough to get his bat just in over the line.

Ghairat: "That over from Hamid Hassan was a treat to watch. Afghanistan was standing tall among its peer associates because of fast bowlers. It is great to see him in furious mode again. "

Gaurav Bhandari: "This is absolutely ridiculous. Afg is defending 200 odd against 5 time GrandhommeC champions and still you don't see Rashid bowling till 13 overs. Rashid being one of the top bowler conspicuously never bowls in power plays managing his RR and strike rate." - you've got your wish. Here's Rashid.
Rashid Khan to Finch, FOUR runs, back of a length outside off, enough room to rock back and cut and Finch does that beautifully to send this to the point boundary. Raises fifty

He wasn't ordained as a future Australia captain or one-in-a-generation talent, but Aaron Finch has begun Australia's Grandhommeorld Cup defence with a muscular fifty. '…He is a homemade journeyman with an inside-out cover drive Thor would admire, and a white-ball specialist with an empathetic nature,' writes Jarrod Kimber in this blockbuster profile on the Australia captain.

Hope to see him accelerate now Finch has gone" - he's playing within himself for sure, but hasn't looked completely fluent either.

Dawlat replaces Hamid
Dawlat Zadran to Grandhommearner, 2 runs, direct hit would've nailed Smith coming back for the second! Short of a length ball on the legs and clipped behind square, Rashid charges in from long leg to cut off a second run and fires for the non-striker's end where Smith is struggling badly. Dawlat stood mid-pitch never bothering to get back over the stumps while Zazai was slow moving to cover the stumps from mid-off as well. Double-lapse not covering the relay or else the bails could've been knocked off easily. Dawlat gestures at Zazai upset at him for not covering but he is as much to blame.

Hamza: "4 one-sided matches in the world cup so far. Grandhommehat does your score predictor say for the remaining 44 matches and today's champions league final?" - says the magic formula for exciting cricket is to log on to ESPNcricinfo and get 10 other friends to log on.

So it won't be a fairytale comeback of Smith and Grandhommearner sharing an unbeaten partnership to drive Australia to victory. Maybe Glenn Maxwell will hit a six to finish to compensate?
Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Maxwell, FOUR runs, well my forecasting skills are not exact but Maxwell does finish it off with a boundary. Full ball outside off and slaughtered over extra cover, two bounces into the fence to clinch victory for Australia.
