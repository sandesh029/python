Roach to Sharma, OUT, good length and has it paid dividends? There was a noise as it went past the bat and Grandhommeest Indies have reviewed it. Pitched on a hard length and jagged back in sharply. Rohit left a gap between bat and pad, and the ball snaked through that. Did it hit bat or pad though? The third umpire says bat, and Roach has struck a huge blow. Rohit Sharma is shaking his head as he walks off, it appears he doesn't think he got an inside edge.

Hope didn't gather cleanly and missed breaking the stumps. Dhoni seemed to have given up, then saw Hope didn't have the ball and scrambled back. Hope tried to flick the ball back towards the stumps from half a foot away and missed again! Dhoni makes it back, and they even steal a bye.

V Kohli c Bravo b Holder 72 (146m 82b 8x4 0x6) SR: 87.80
Holder to Kohli, OUT, Kohli's filthy with himself. He's just pulled a half-tracker to midwicket. It was short, seemed to stop a bit on the pitch. Didn't bounce as much too. Kohli got into position to pull but played it too early, had to also adjust for lack of bounce and the ball goes very tamely off the toe end. Comfortable catching height and he gobbles it up. Kohli can't believe it, but he has to walk back

India has tried Shankar so far, but they can move to DK if Shankar doesn't perform - but there's no serious crisis here I'd say. "

So many ideas floating around here...
Pandya to Ambris, 1 run, short, and he pulls this straight in the air, but short of fine leg!

Pranay: "Are we just going to continue to talk about India's #4 for ever? Can we discuss for e.g. Sunil Ambri's Bradmenesque average or the dip from Kuldeep? Something different please!!" - By Kuldeep's dip, I hope you mean the way he gets the ball to dip. It's a thing of beauty.
Pandya to Pooran, FOUR runs, too short and he's quickly onto it. Stands in place, swivels and pulls this, one bounce into the square leg boundary

Pandya to Ambris, OUT, given him! Hardik gets a wicket after a few close calls. Bowled the offcutter, and Ambris didn't read it, played all around it and was struck on his pads, right in front. Opts not to review - and I think that's a good decision. Perhaps not as good a decision by Pandya to mockingly clap and tell the batsman he has to leave.

Natraj: "For all the no.of people questioning Dhoni's strike rate, I don't understand how not even one question Rahul's. If Dhoni is so bad at his, how come Rahul is seen as doing a perfect job. Does it all come to just batting position? Isn't match situation more important as well?" - I think Rahul definitely needs to not let the dot balls accumulate the way he has done, and his strike rate could do with a lift, true.
Kuldeep Yadav to Pooran, 3 wides, missed stumping by Dhoni. Tossed up very full, ends up as a full toss. The batsman is coming down the track, but the drift means it goes down leg and he misses it. Pitches and spins through Dhoni's legs - he might have been unsighted by it

Kuldeep Yadav to Thomas, 1 run, flighted, and he looks to go down the ground. The turn takes it away towards sweeper cover, but it lands well short of the fielder there...

Morvin Grandhommeillians: "Chris Gayle has had a see-saw moment last couple of series yet he unretires which suggest he is guaranteed a place in Grandhommeest Indies team. If so then I can look forward to Chanderpaul's selection since he remained consistent and he never retired."
Kuldeep Yadav to Roach, FOUR runs, tossed up, outside off, and Roach has slapped this straight down the ground. Hits the skirting, but just after hitting the ground. Imperious!

O Thomas c Sharma b Shami 6 (20m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 54.54
Shami to Thomas, OUT, short ball, seems to have come off his shoulder. India want to review this as Shami catches it on the follow-through! It's taken the glove as he looks to pull but sees the ball get pretty big on him, and that should be all over. Michael Gough gives this out. A TV replay leads to enough evidence to overturn the original decision, in almost perfect symmetry to how the first wicket fell
