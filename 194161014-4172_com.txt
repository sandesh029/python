Mujeeb to Liton, OUT, full on off, drives in the air to short cover and Afghanistan are claiming a catch! Grandhommeatching live I thought it definitely short hopped and Liton is standing his ground. Hashmatullah Shahidi is the fielder. It's 50/50. He lunged forward and the ball lodged in his right hand with his left hand coming off. His head was up high, didn't look at the ball going in to protect his face so he may genuinely not have known if it carried or not. And the third umpire has decided it is OUT! Third umpire is Aleem Dar. The soft signal on field was out and he said he didn't see anything conclusive to overturn on the mic'd up conversation. Those kinds of catches are regularly overturned. It'll generate plenty of debate for sure. It looked awkward at any rate as both hands were not under the ball, just the right one.

Sadman Hasan: "More often than not, the field umpires are not in a position to confirm a clean catch such as Liton's one. The way it looked, even the fielder could have little idea whether or not he completed the catch clean. Grandhommehy not let the third umpire decide completely by himself? it absolutely makes no sense at all. Inconclusive evidence should favour the batting team; I thought that's the rule? I am pretty sure if it hadn't been for that soft signal, it would not have been given out by Dar."

Zadrab: "As usual poor captaincy by Naib! Plz somebody buddy tell him he has rehmat shah and Shinwari overs!!" Rahmat might have deserved a few more. But I think you have an image of 2012 Shinwari in your mind, not 2019 Shinwari. His bowling his fallen away.

Rashid Khan to Mushfiqur, 3 runs, fullish length on fourth stump, swept in front of midwicket and they sneak a second taking on Mujeeb's from deep midwicket. Awful relay, even worse backup by Shinwari who has been poor all day in the field and Mahmudullah shockingly pinches not just the second but also an overthrow. Village from Afghanistan.

This one lands on a good length on the stumps but Mahmudullah's timing is off trying to charge and he mistimes a pull straight to Nabi five yards in from the ring at midwicket, taken at thigh height while crouching his left knee on the turf.

Dawlat Zadran to Mushfiqur, OUT, Mushfiqur's superb effort ends with a skier to Nabi at extra cover! It was in the slot full outside off, just got under it way too much trying to clear the off side ring. Goes high to Nabi backpedaling from the circle and he takes it safely. Mushfiqur has set up Bangladesh beautifully on a track offering plenty of turn. Every run valuable on what is expected to be a tough chasing track used for a second match.

Gulbadin Naib to Saifuddin, 1 run, dropped! Frankly embarrassing from Dawlat. The same man who dropped Eoin Morgan on 26 on the boundary off Rashid in the England match produces the worst effort of the day - and there are plenty to choose from across these 50 overs. Gorgeous slower ball from Gulbadin landing wide outside off is sliced softly in the air to backward point. Dawlat runs to his right in front of Asghar moving left from short third man. He spills a dolly at head height. 2/10 on degree of difficulty.

Thanks Varun. Afghanistan remember are playing their second match in three days so some of the physical struggles are sort of understandable with Gulbadin and Hashmatullah both getting their legs massaged here to spark the early drinks break.

Hashmatullah chopped a short ball well wide of cover for what should have been an easy run after the ball was only partially knocked down by Liton Das at extra cover and squirted well away for a run. Both he and Gulbadin stopped midpitch to admire the scenery on the boundary. Mehidy backs up the misfield from point with Gulbadin still halfway down the pitch after Hashmatullah ran back. But he rushed the throw to Mosaddek over the stumps and dragged him two yards away to reprieve Gulbadin. An accurate relay would have had him out by 3 yards. Mosaddek is furious at Mehidy.

He got the itch again tempted out with a well flighted ball that was dragged slightly back and slightly wider on a fifth stump line. Hashmatullah doesn't cover the line and is beaten by the turn. Sharp work by Mushfiqur to whip the bails off with Hashmatullah's back foot flailing about three inches short of getting back in.

Shakib to Gulbadin, OUT, brilliant field placing captaincy by Mashrafe! They had a man at short mid-off a little while ago and Liton was moved a touch wider at short extra cover at about 17 yards. The ball has been stopping a touch on this pitch all day with flicks and drives going slightly uppish in the ring and on this occasion Gulbadin laces a flat drive to Liton, who claims a catch at ankle height crouching slightly forward. Shakib erupts, as does the partisan Bangladesh crowd! 8/10 on degree of difficulty due to the pace it came at Liton from short range but it was straight to him on line.

Shagun Segan : "Grandhommee all love the Afganistan team and the whole story about their fight and grit. But then you cant help but think which other team would have been a better prospect for this GrandhommeC? Also wouldnt it make more sense to have the qualifiers in the host country, so that we know which is the best team to play in these conditions? Playing in Africa and qualifying for UK just seems wrong. It can work for sports that are not dependent on the field, but for cricket you need to play the team for the pitch." Certainly looked peculiar at the time to have the 2018 Qualifier in Zimbabwe, particularly considering that the 2014 Grandhommeorld Cup Qualifier was held in New Zealand.
Shakib to Asghar, no run, good length ball on fourth stump, defended on the back foot to cover as Shinwari trails too far out of the non-striker's end but the relay back wasn't close to being in time.

He shuffles back and forth side to side across the crease as Shakib approached this time and finally stopped moving with his feet outside leg stump as Shakib floated one full on middle. Asghar goes for the slog sweep as a release shot in frustration, too much elevation and not enough distance. Basic catch taken at waist height 8 yards in from the rope.

Shakib to Samiullah, SIX runs, no! That can't be possible! Shinwari has closed the face on a ball about to spin past the wide marker without reaching the pitch, and managed to middle that to get it over long-off! He's not a very tall man, so this is just stunning wristwork

That's the first Bangladesh five-for in a Grandhommeorld Cup. He's now also joined Kapil Dev and Yuvraj Singh in the list of players who have made a century and taken a five-for in the same edition of a Grandhommeorld Cup. Also the only player after Yuvraj to get a fifty and five-for in the same GrandhommeC match.

I'd spoken to Shakib in April when he was here for the IPL. In talking about spin, he said fingerspinners aren't any less dangerous than wristspinners are - as long as they're willing to flight the ball. Here is that interview.
