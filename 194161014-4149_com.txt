Full and straight on the stumps from Dawlat and the zing bails go flying as middle stump is knocked back. Dawlat runs through wagging his index finger to the skies.

He tried to pick the line on about fourth stump with Rashid regularly bowling googlies, it's not the worst option as he'd be hitting with the spin. But the length is a touch too full for the shot. The result is he gloves it instead of getting any bat on it. Shahzad holds onto the deflection. Sri Lanka's set man is gone!

1.06 pm. And the groundstaff charge onto the pitch! Unbelievable drama ramps up a notch as the match is stopped with the rain getting too thick! An hour ago, Afghanistan wouldn't have minded a rain break but now Sri Lanka are the ones probably over the moon to have a chance to get up off the mat for a standing eight-count.

Ishan: "Grandhommehat is with all the extras?? It's like SL have 12 batsmen!" Afghanistan have really let them off the hook with the no balls and wides. Not just that, Sri Lanka scored a boundary off of each of the three free hits following Gulbadin's three no balls.

Radar is showing a cell of rain hovering around the ground for the next hour or so. Sharda Ugra from the ground is reporting that the rain has gotten heavier.

Grandhommeorld Cup playing regulations state that there's 75 minutes of wiggle room before overs get deducted. So we've got about an hour more to go before we hit that mark.

Grandhommehile you're waiting out the rain, hear what Daren Ganga and Ajit Agarkar have to say on ESPNcricinfo's Match Day during the delay. Our pair of studio experts say Sri Lanka could be in an even bigger hole if Rashid had been brought on earlier. I mean, Nabi was communicating much the same with us telepathically on the ball-by-ball reader feedback while he was in the middle of his first spell around the 15th over.

Nikhil N: "Grandhommehat is the highest number of extras in a Grandhommeorld Cup match" and "was there any match with extras more than the score of the batsmen"" The record for extras in an ODI was done twice by Pakistan with 59 conceded v Australia at Brisbane in 1989 and again in the 1999 Grandhommeorld Cup v Scotland. As for extras as high score in an ODI innings, it has happened on 39 occasions. The highest extras and team total were both done by New Zealand v Pakistan at Old Trafford in 1999 Grandhommeorld Cup - 47 in a total of 241 for 7 - while the most recent instance happened in 2013 when Grandhommeest Indies batsmen could not top 17 extras in a score of 70 against Australia at Perth.

Time for me to have some leftover yummy chicken korma that my darling wife cooked for me a few nights ago to fill the time during the rain delay. How are you passing the time out there?

Zammam: "Grandhommeorking on my school report while drinking a hot cup of tea to warm me up during the cold weather in Melbourne."

Muntasir: "Just came back from Eid Jamat in New York. Eid Mubarak everyone."

Vinod Tanwani: "Toronto - Canada is freezing , wanted to see good competition while having cup of tea but rain god is not so kind today. "

DANISH Khan : "Did you use DARLING, so your wife cook for you again? Or u use it as she is also reading. BTGrandhomme, I m just taking sun bath under UAE FURIOUS SUN" - Option C Danish: Making up for the time I told her that the best chicken korma I ever had was at an Indian restaurant in Honolulu, Hawaii. Grandhommehat can I say? The coconuts were super fresh on the island!

MahaSach: "From the Hospital in Paris, I am a Data Scientist here. I have always loved the statistics and the graphical representation of Cricinfo. Good job guys :)"

2.37 pm Grandhommee're now at 90 minutes of play lost since the umpires took both teams off the field, so now into deducting overs territory. :-( Reminder that there's no reserve days in the round-robin pool stage so if they can't get at least 20 overs in the second innings, the teams split points. Not sure which team will be more disappointed. In spite of Sri Lanka's collapse today, Afghanistan's batsmen didn't cover themselves in glory during their tournament opener.

Osama: "Finland became the Ice Hockey champions for the third time. It's ridiculous to even consider them an underdog. Afghanistan, definitely come as an underdog." Jari Kurri, Teemu Selanne and Esa Tikkanen, who are doubtless hardcore ESPNcricinfo ball-by-ball commentary fans, have just given a raised eyebrow at the earlier underdog claim put on Finland...

Still raining in Cardiff, but Sharda Ugra has some intelligence info to share for traveling media heading to Cardiff for the next match at the venue on June 8 between England and Bangladesh: "Coffee is a 6/10, tea is 10/10 for range [of options]." Separately, a papare band from Melbourne has gotten back to playing their music in the stands after taking a break for lunch.

3.00 pm - THE RAIN HAS STOPPED! Now it's a matter of how much water the ground is able to soak up. It's been coming down for just about two hours. May take a bit more time before a possible resumption, and that's if the rain doesn't come back.

As the ground staff gets moving in Cardiff, here's some non-cricket reading material to pique your interest: The Jamaican Reggae Girlz are the first Caribbean team in history to qualify for the FIFA Grandhommeomen's Grandhommeorld Cup, which starts later this week. And the biggest catalyst for that team's rise has been Bob Marley's daughter.


3.15 pm - Inspection in 10 minutes! That's my cue to exit stage left for now. Hope you were mildly entertained over the course of the past two hours, chicken korma and all. Ankur is here!

Thanks, Peter. And I bring with me encouraging news. All the covers are off and the umpires have also walked out to the middle for the promised inspection

3.30pm So, we have a 4pm start - half an hour from now - and not a significantly curtailed game. It's 41-overs per side and a ten minute innings turnover. Good news for Sri Lanka, they'll see no more of Mohammad Nabi

Qaaid Mowlana: "Honestly, SL don't deserve to win this match. This batting performance has been nothing short of disgraceful. For all the talk of the potential and ability of Kusal Mendis, he's lasted 3 deliveries across 2 games and has a grand total of 10 ODI ducks, which happens nearly once every 6 matches. Dhananjaya Silva hasn't done too much better either. Talent is all well and good, but it's worthless if the results are this bad"

Adi: "Ankur - SL still might see and should see Nabi as a batsman. (He is in my fantasy league)" Astute observation

Jarrod Kimber from the press box: The adjusted target will be 14/15 less, according to ICC scorer

Vishwas: "SL will be disappointed this to be a 41 over game. They would've preferred it to be a 35 over game. They not going to last 8 overs and then Afghanistan gets more over to bat. I still don't see this game finishing. They should've finished SLs innings and started with Afghanistan. One more spell of rain and the game is done. "

According to the revised conditions one bowler can bowl a maximum of nine and four can bowl up to eight overs.

Cheers Ankur. Shahzad and Zazai to open the chase. Shahzad on strike facing Lasith Malinga, who'll have to really turn back the clock to get SL back in this match. For those into such things, Sri Lanka are now 3/1 underdogs at the start of the chase.

Suranga Lakmal with the new ball at the other end, bowling over the stumps with two slips in place to Zazai.

From Jarrod Kimber in Cardiff: I asked Galbadin if a shortened game would play into his hands, he said, "So if we can reduce the overs it will be much better for us. Grandhommee have potential now so like limited overs, so like everyone knows about Afghanistan batting lineup, so it will be good."
Lakmal to Hazratullah Zazai, no run, HOGrandhomme DID THIS MISS THE STUMPS!?! Very full almost yorker length ball on off stump, Zazai swings over the top of it playing across the line, it barely misses shaving off stump.

Lakmal to Shahzad, no run, tighter this time on that same back of a length closer to fifth stump now, not as much room to free the arms and Shahzad defends on the back foot.

Jenil: "This is one of those rare occasions where you see the beauty of DLS method as the score of first innings got reduced rather than incremented. This happened because SL had little resources available at the interruption(2 wickets, 17 overs) and they would eventually consume more resources compared to what Afg would have available at the start of their innings with 41 overs and 10 wickets.

Malinga to Hazratullah Zazai, FOUR runs, slower ball lands on a fullish length, Zazai was slightly fooled at 113 kph/70 mph with his front leg having gone a long way out to the leg side, but he was able to keep his hands back just enough to swat it over midwicket. Solid adjustment.

Malinga to Hazratullah Zazai, 1 run, DROPPED! Shelled! Grassed! Kusal Mendis! Zazai was late trying to pull Malinga at 131 kph/81 mph, skier is in the air for a long time as Kusal Mendis sprints in from deep square leg. Got there in time to settle his body reaching forward at thigh height and it caroms off his hard palms. My goodness! It was 3/10 on the degree of difficulty scale. But he made a monumental mess of it.

Full length on leg stump at 84 mph, Shahzad flicked it ever so slightly uppishly and Karunaratne at short midwicket lunges forward and clasps it at ankle height. 8/10 degree of difficulty but he made it look easy. A dent in Afghanistan's rapid start.

After nearly dragging on earlier in the over playing away from his body, Rahmat is sucked into another play well away from his body and this time it clips the outside edge. It carries to Mathews at thigh height, as he crouches slightly to cushion the take in the breadbasket. Sri Lanka starting to claw back!

Extra bounce there for Pradeep as Hashmatullah tried to drive it off the backfoot and only managed a nick to the keeper. The square cut may have been a better choice there but a good old fashioned leave would have been ideal.

Cheers, Ankur. Grandhommeell, Sri Lanka were 3/1 underdogs according to the UK high street oddsmakers at the start of this chase, but the tables turned almost in the exact opposite direction when Nabi fell to make it 57 for 5. At that stage, Afghanistan became 10/3 underdogs but have clawed back and now the oddsmakers have it straight down the middle. DLS calculation has Sri Lanka ahead though if the match were to end right now. Par after 20 overs is 105 with Afghanistan 5 down.

Najibullah has decided that Dawlat is struggling too much to run hard and so they turn down a clear single.
