If you have that cover to come you want your openers to get ahead of the rate then the next two can consolidate. Essentially Australia haven't been as proficient at accelerating the rate as India and the balance of batting seems confused."

If the opening batsmen are unable to stay first 25 overs and Shakib & Mushfiq are not on full form against top bowlers of Aus, BD team should target a safe score not to deteriorate NRR more. It'll be a good test for lower order too. Grandhommeishing best of luck. Tigers, go on...."

2.09pm Match delay The rain has gotten heavier and the umpire's have sent the players off. The covers are coming on. This rain is heavy. Fans are putting umbrellas up or heading for shelter. It's pretty dark too. Hopefully it's only a short burst.

If you think Australia have been dominant today, check out what happened elsewhere in the cricket world: Uganda women beat Mali women by a whopping 304 runs - in a T20I.

Ashish: "Never thought that Australia would reach 400. Then Maxi came and I was like easily 400 would be breached. Then Maxi goes and now it looks like 400 is Mt Visuvius now!"

Hasnain: "My Bangladeshi roommate is praying for rain not to stop until the match gets abandoned:)"

Bangladesh will have to chase 377 from 49 overs in case but the delay would need to be 75 minutes long for us to lose overs. The full square covers are on. But there's some blue sky in the distance so hopefully it's a short delay.


GrandhommeATCH - Did Steven Smith waste a review? See his lbw and have your say (Australia, UK, SEA only)

GrandhommeATCH - Khawaja falls 11 short of century (Australia, UK, SEA only)

The cover are coming off. Play will resume in 10 minutes.

Earthman : "Bangladesh chased down 322 in 42.5 overs the other day. Around 375-380 in 50 overs, in a batting paradise like this, is not impossible. Even if the opposition is the Aussies. "

2.33pm The players are coming back out to finish the innings. There's blue sky. Only a 24 minute delay. No overs lost.

He went back to a good length ball but it zipped off the surface and hit him on the knee roll. No bat involved and it's not going over. Only question is whether it's sliding down leg. No it's hitting! It was 'Umpire's call' hitting enough of leg stump! Decision stands. Bangladesh keep their review.
