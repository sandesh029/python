Henry to Thirimanne, OUT, huge appeal. I mean a really huge appeal. Plays all around a full delivery and is struck on the pMathews. Only doubt was did it pitch outside leg. . The answer is an emphatic no. Grandhommeilliamson goes for a review. Pitching in line, impact in line, hitting. Three reds, so he will have to walk back. Grandhommehat a review! Thirimanne is gone.

Ferguson to Karunaratne, 1 run, outstanding from Santner at deep square! Or has he taken it cleanly? They're going upstairs. Not out comes the decision because replays inconclusive. The soft-signal was not-out too. Dimuth makes room to slap this but the bowler follows him, so now he decides to take on the short ball and pull, no timing and gets it high on the bat. Santner anticipates the stroke and runs in quickly and as this descends, put in a full-length dive to complete the catch. The on-field umpires went upstairs to check if this was a bump ball. They clearly felt there was some part of the ball touching the ground.

Pratheek Jain: "Some teams are wobbly starters. Take Mumbai Indians for example. But they make up in the later stage of the tournament. Don't judge too soon. Some teams take longer to get their nerves settled. Pakistan have historically been that way. Have faith in whichever team your supporting. They won't let you down."

Pakistan have always been unpredictable and could come back next game looking like the best in the world. So, the only disappointment till now has been ENG v. SA not going down to the wire. Calm down people."

John: "Seems funny that England made what seemed like a string statement in the first game and yet look like being in no better than third place and possibly in fourth after tonight. There's a long way to go, of course, and you'd say that SA were almost certainly the strongest of the losing sides in the first four games. That holds true if Australia defeat Afghanistan and possibly even if they don't."
Udana to Guptill, 2 runs, whips this to deep square, lazy effort by Thirimanne, should've never been two
