12.30pm Welcome to Lord's, for what should be a cracking 2015 final re-match between New Zealand and Australia. With Pakistan's resurgence in recent games, this is an almost-must win situation for the New Zealanders, who were unbeaten in the tournament until they ran into Sarfaraz Ahmed's team over this week. Lots to look forward to -- this is Debayan Sen, and Alagappan Muthu will join me in the course of this evening. Let's get you started with Andrew McGlashan's preview
The first bit of good news - it's a bright and sunny afternoon in London. "Roasting...perfect weather for a barbie," says Alan Gardner, who will be in charge of the #LiveReport today for us. In the meantime, here's some good listening material for you to dive straight into. Pakistan have their 1992 parallels, England have been talking about the Cup coming home for a while now, Australia are Australia. Through all of it, India have quietly got to the doorsteps of the semi-final, (almost) without putting a foot wrong so far. Is it their World Cup to lose now? Our latest Talking World Cup podcast has more (and it's also on Apple Podcasts)

Sriram: "Read Miller's article on how Finch's Australia have shed their aggression but not their winning ways. It led me to an interesting insight. AB's team was molded in his shape to be fighters. Taylor's and Waugh's teams were ruthless. Ponting's were world beaters just like him. Now they're being molded into Finchy's style. No outward aggression yet fighters and winner. " --- I did commentary on a few of Australia's games in India and UAE against Pakistan ahead of the World Cup, and you could see him growing into the role he's playing now with his team. For those that missed the article by any chance, it's right here

"Ish Sodhi must play today, as well as Santer. This wicket has enough for the spinners too. Whoever wins the toss will bat first. 280 to 290 will be a challenging total in this wicket," is Ashish Das' early prophecy

"Good morning all. Absolutely blistering at Lord's today. I speed-walked up from Baker Street and am now a very soggy puddle. Pitch has had a shave but still looks green-tinged. But with this heat, I wouldn't anticipate many demons surviving long into the match," is Andrew Miller's first contribution for this evening

Yudhbir Yadav: "On 26th I had my civil service exam in Rajasthan (India) where there was a question about Horward Gardner's theory of Intelligence... And my intelligence was reading it as Alan Gardner's theory of Intelligence... #Cricket_fever..." --- Maybe you were just really, really, really, really looking forward to his insights on the #LiveReport

Must credit Francis Payne on Twitter for pointing this out initially, but this is New Zealand's first ever World Cup ODI at Lord's! Also their World Cup record against Australia is 3-7 heading into today

Kane Williamson: ""We would have batted too. Two changes - Ish Sodhi comes in for Matt Henry, and also Henry Nicholls comes in for Colin Munro."

Aaron Finch: "Hopefully later on slow up a little, and take a bit of spin. I think it's a difficult wicket from the previous one. No changes, everyone who contributed to the win has done really well. Everyone has played at some point, so it's going well."

On the broadcast, Ian Smith reckons this will be a good pitch for chasing, and thinks it is a 300-pitch. Gaurav Sundararaman, meanwhile, pings me the scorecard for the only Day-Night match at Lord's before

New Zealand: Guptill. Nicholls, Williamson (c), Taylor, Latham (wk), Neesham, Grandhomme, Santner, Sodhi, Ferguson, Boult

Australia: Finch (c), Warner, Khawaja, Smith, Maxwell, Stoinis, Carey (wk), Cummins, Starc, Lyon, Behrendorff

1.02pm Time for the toss: Australia have won the toss and will bat


PS - if you're absolutely gagging to know more about Henry Nicholls (and why wouldn't you be) Alagappan had a chat with him earlier this year on his rise as a red-ball cricketer

These sounds will be haunting Lord's today. The home of cricket getting a taste of a rivalry that is more how do you do than how dare you. Sure, it's pretty awful timing for the fans back home considering it's the middle of the night in New Zealand and Australia right now. But at least it's the weekend. So come on. Pull out that phone. Text your mates. Call them over and have an all night cricket party. Doesn't actually sound like the worst thing in the world, does it? (Don't answer that)

There is a sound that echoes around the MCG too. The roar of 100,000 fans as they watched a left-arm speed demon shatter those poor defenseless stumps.

There is a sound that echoes around Eden Park. A crack like lightning. The echo of a picture perfect straight drive... FOR SIX.

Kartik: "Does Baker Street really exist in London, as Miller claims?" --- It does, indeed, and I can verify from experience that a pleasant summer's day in London is the best time to take an absolutely long walk. By the way, Gerry Rafferty even composed a paen to Baker Street

F May: "Keen for this one.Trans-tasman rivalry is decades old. Has been bitter at times too (think the underarm ball, Hadlee single handedly tormenting the Aussies, the years of Bevan's middle order runaways or NZ's recent rise). Here's hoping for an awesome contest!" --- Oh completely!

David: "Interesting stat - KW and Ross Taylor have identical ODI average coming into this game (48.12), hopefully they can both increase their averages today!" --- Could have a role to play too, if Australia get the kind of start they have been getting this World Cup

1.24pm The teams have walked down the Long Room on to the field, and we have the anthems on now

SimonR: "Per your introduction - why is this an almost must win for NZ. They have 11 points.. Even if they lose their last two matches the possible alternatives of Bangladesh or Pakistan (even if England squeak through) can only get to 11 max and have a worse NRR. NZ are safe it is England at risk" --- Hence the emphasis on 'almost'. A heavy defeat today could put New Zealand in a bit of a tricky spot going into their final game too, remember

Carey: "Still no room for Tom Blundell who performed so well in the warm up games and is one of the best NZ batsmen around spin bowling. When will his time come?"

Abhijato: "Speaking of Baker Street, my Crystal Ball is wearing its Holmes-inspired deerstalker already. Warner & Finch v Ferguson & Boult will participate in a classical opening overs contest, it says... Don't be late for the start, folks!"

1.29pm Warner and Finch walk out to the middle. Warner will take strike, with two slips in place for Trent Boult. In fact, three slips now
Boult to Warner, no run, a little bit of shape away, full, and Warner defends this

Ferguson to Warner, OUT, short, and he has got Warner with a snorter! Delivered at 142kph, and following him as he looks to sway out of its way, this ball takes off and takes Warner along its way through to Latham. Ferguson had no doubt, and neither did Warner. Both openers dismissed this early, wow!

Thanks Debayen! Hey party people! We get to enjoy an extended spell from Thunder Boult.
Boult to Khawaja, no run, bouncer which Khawaja tries to hook away, but he's gonna need a stepladder for that. The Lord's hospitality doesn't quite go that far
0
10.1
Boult to Khawaja, no run, beats him again! This time with good old fashioned line and length outside off. Khawaja has this habit of reaching out away from his body - because he rarely moves his feet, especially forward. And that time there's just enough away movement to beat the edge
0
10.2
Boult to Khawaja, 1 run, goes for the magic ball, pitching leg and swinging away to take the leading edge. No such luck as Khawaja flicks the ball on the pads to deep square leg

Boult to Smith, 3 runs, goes round the stumps straight away to SS, who is only too happy to work with the angle and flick the fuller delivery from outside off down the ground past the right of the bowler

Boult to Khawaja, 1 run, gets across his stumps because he reads the short ball early and knows there's a sprawling gap at long leg. Good pull game plan. Good pull shot

Shariq: "Amazing how someone bowling 6 overs on a trot is an extended spell nowadays. Clearly remember those days when 15 overs were the fielding restrictions and the first 2 bowlers used to consistently bowl 6 overs each on the trot. " --- The middle overs have become key in ODIs. And teams need a strike bowler to operate there
Boult to Smith, no run, stays over the wicket - with no mid-off - and pitches the ball up on middle stump. Smith springs across and then, after teasing all of us with those rubber wrists, only defends. Boooo!

SPD Smith c Guptill b Ferguson 5 (13m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 62.50
Ferguson to Smith, OUT, falls into the trap! New Zealand had a leg gully lurking. They were going to attack SS with the short ball. They were hoping he'd flick one in the air and this guy can grab it. But this is a full blooded pull shot. This is coming off at a zillion miles an hour. And it's not even right at the fielder. A fielder who's already dropped two catches. Guptill doesn't care though. He spots the ball early enough. He dives to his left quickly enough. Sticks out his hand and comes up with an absolute specy! This is going to be one of the catches of the tournament. Smith's copped the end of two of those now and New Zealand are now nice and snug in the driver's seat. The broadcast graphics say Guptill was only 17 m away from the batsman. Also, in terms of reaction time, he only had 0.6 seconds to pull off that miracle. #WOAH!

First over of the World Cup for Ish Sodhi. Good on New Zealand for picking him and getting him into it straight away. Opposition under pressure. Middle order exposed. Best time for a legspinnner
Sodhi to Khawaja, no run, googly to start and I'm not sure Khawaja picks it. Reaches out to defend and is comfortably beaten
0

Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run, resorts to the sweep straight away - which gives a batsmen who isn't reading the turn a little more margin for error - and takes a ball on a length on off stump for a trip to fine leg

Ferguson to Stoinis, 1 run, bounces him and Stoinis can't get out of the way. How can he when it's 148 kph?

In January, Andy Murray had hip-resurfacing surgery and thought Wimbledon could be his last event, if he even made it there. Now, Murray is back at the site of his greatest triumph to play doubles -- and it could just be the start.
Sodhi to Stoinis, FOUR runs, over mid-on! Stoinis sees one tossed up and knows it's just got to go. Lunges forward and whacks it down the ground and gets just about lucky enough to beat a leaping KW at the 30-yard circle

Steven Smith's dismissal to that leg-gully set up has given way to Marcus Stoinis, who was done in by silly mid-on at Eden Park in 2017. Kane Williamson and his wacky fields. If you ask him about it later, he'll probably say he has forgotten it like he did here
Sodhi to Stoinis, no run, zips in off the pitch looking for lbw, but Stoinis brings the bat down in time, and importantly it's straight. Sodhi's doing very well here

Neesham to Stoinis, OUT, caught behind! Neesh delivers an absolute peach. A cross-seamer that hits the deck. The line is close enough to off stump. The length though is in-between. Not full enough for the drive. Not short enough for the cut. Stoinis presses forward gamely, looking to block the ball out. But it's mischief not done yet. It decks away off the pitch, takes the outside edge and settles in the keeper's gloves. Top stuff.

Neesham to Maxwell, OUT, WHAT A CATCH! If you thought Guptill had one of the rippers for the day, Jimmy Neesham has just sent in his nomination for moment of the day! It comes off the bottom of Maxwell's blade as he looks to pull a short one outside off, and Neesham dives away to his left and picks up a one-handed grab.

Thanks Debayen. Khawaja and Carey (why is he batting at 7?!?!?) are keeping Australia in this. ICYMI, this ain't a 300 pitch. It's slow. Occasionally balls are kicking up off a good length. Good captains - and Finch certainly is one - can plug a batsman's scoring opportunities here by working the angles right. And Australia have some incredible bowlers. A 200-type score could produce a proper contest here.

Williamson to Khawaja, 2 runs, nicks past the keeper! If KW's getting spin off a pitch, you know it ain't straight forward. Khawaja is drawn into the drive. The ball dips in front of him, messing up his timing. Then it turns, securing the outside edge

Grandhomme to Carey, FOUR runs, superb hit! And it's because he is basically pulling a good length ball outside off. You know, the kind you're told to bowl in Test cricket. Only here, this extremely talented left-hander picks up the length so early and also takes the extra credit points as well by hitting with a relatively straight bat to send the ball skimming past wide mid-on (can't cross-bat those balls because they're not short enough)

Khawaja walks across to access the on side, but misses out on contact and in fact walks right outside the line of the ball.

It's a perfect full length, and there's no sign of bat near that. The only question could be where it pitched, I would think. The bat hits ground, but that is after the ball passes through and crashes into his right foot. It's out, and that's a hat-trick for Trent Boult!

Colin Grandhomme did a great job, too, and it was down to a rearguard from Alex Carey and Usman Khawaja, with a good little hand from Pat Cummins, that has lifted them to a fighting total. Still everything to play for here, surely? Al Muthu will be at the helm when we return for the New Zealand chase. Stick around till then!

Martin Guptill, who pull off possibly the catch of the tournament, is walking through the Long Room with Henry Nicholls, who is on World Cup debut and playing out of position. New Zealand would back themselves to chase this and get into the semis. But it won't be easy and that's not just because of Australia's bowling attack either. Lord's has rolled out a very sporting surface. Right, here's Jason Behrendorff with two slips in
Behrendorff to Guptill, 1 run, sweetly timed to the left of mid-off. Good signs for Guptill, who sometimes seems suspect against left-arm quicks because of the ball coming back in. This one though just pitches on a length and carries on with the angle, allowing him to play that favourite on the up drive

It was as if we had come to watch cricket rather than enjoy the entertainment. " Heh.

Starc to Guptill, no run, should I leave, should I play? Should I even try? This is testing bowling from Australia's strike weapon. He gets his radar perfect.

Starc to Nicholls, no run, dangerous ball! It's the one that he slings out towards the off side but in mid-air it curls back into the left-hander. Essentially the same one Stokes got. Except it isn't a yorker and perhaps that's why Nicholls is able to block it from crashing into his sticks

The bat needs to come down around it and it can't make the journey in time. Australia think about the review, but they don;t go for it in the end. Worried about it going down leg, was Behrendorff and so Finch didn't go for it. Replays show it would have been umpire's call on hitting the stumps

Great captaincy. Aussie will win this quite easily I predict. NZ missed their opportunity." --- I can see that point. But this is the partnership that New Zealand's entire ODI game revolves around. You'd think as an opposition, you'd want to break it before it gets going

Starc to Williamson, OUT, caught behind. One genius gets the other! And it's that dab. It's the go to shot. It's the one that feeds every one of his ODI innings. But not this one. The ball angling across the right hander - a cutter set up for the fourth slip - takes the edge as KW plays the dab and goes through to the keeper. Australia celebrate. Starc celebrates although should he reallly? He keeps taking so many wickets in his first over of a new spell that maybe he should just yawn and wave bye-bye to the other guy

Sam : "@ Rahul. I agree completely. The volume of cricket has led to a dilution of quality since teams keep resting their main bowlers for those meaningless ODIs to keep them fresh for tests. That has led to a massive increase in averages for modern ODI batsmen, where more players average over 50 that at any time in history. You don't see the same in tests, where only 4-5 players average 50 plus. Partly due to excellent test pitches recently but a lot to do with the best bowlers being on the park. "

Starc to Sodhi, OUT, shapes into him from wide of the crease, and he has been caught in front of the crease. Called leg-before, but they review this. Nothing wrong with the front foot, and there doesn't appear to be any bat on it either. The impact is fine, and the wickets stay with umpire's call. That's Starc now emulating his haul of wickets from 2015!

Sukrit Gupta: "@Prashant, I agree with you. There are a lot of parallels between 2003 and 2019, with the roles seem to be reversed between Ind and Aus. What Sachin did for Ind in '03, Finch/Warner are doing it here for Aus. In '03 when ever Aus batting faltered, their bowlers decimated the opposition. The same is being done by Indian Bowlers here. IN '03 Aus were a ruthless unbeatable force and Ind were the second best, here Ind have been unbeatable and ruthless and Aus so far have been second best. "

Starc to Santner, OUT, short, and he holes out to fine leg! Starc has five, and Australia have crushed New Zealand in an imposing performance where they were on the back foot for the first hour and a bit in this contest. Cricket, bloody hell! It was short and quick, and Santner actually got inside the line of the ball and was looking to hook this towards long leg. The pace on the ball took the top edge and made it go finer, and Behrendorff made no mistake
