 Of course they have their reasoning for not playing him. They want Hafeez offspin against GrandhommeI lefties. But never thought face-off would be between Asif and Hafeez in this situation. Dropping the one thing your batting needs just seems off

 Grandhommeindies have played Pooran instead of injured lewis. This could be a blessing in disguise for them. They have the right mix  of hitters and consolidators and bat deep till 8 with a back up keeper also to give hope some breathing space. #GrandhommeC19

He has seen a brother get shot and killed at 11, cried tears of joy with fellow Grandhommeest Indians during the IPL auctions, and said, 'Yo when I bowl to Andre (Russell) in the nets, he don't hit my ball'.

Thomas to Babar Azam, OUT, brilliant catch by Shai Hope He's sprouted wings and flown to his right - and I mean flown because he was airborne and parallel to the ground - to pull off a stunner. That earlier drop isn't going to cost Grandhommeest Indies much after all. Outswinger that was going away from him, Babar had a somewhat lazy waft at it and took a thick edge. Should have ordinarily gone between keeper and slip, or been parried to the ground. Until Hope took off.

All the interviews he's had since 2014 saying how he wanted to bring the Grandhommeindies up the rankings even as his team lost on the field. He always backs his teammates even when they're going through tough times and is showing himself to be arguably the best man-managing captain around today. "

Short, short, short - wicket. This was another short one, Imad tried to pull it, got a top edge that swirled to Gayle's right at slip, and he stretched out to pluck it with one hand.

Holder to Hasan Ali, OUT, soft, soft dismissal and again it's to a ball that's shorter than a good length. This was not a bouncer, but back of a length outside off. Hasan thought he'd have a thrash at it and went for the pull, but the problem is, he's not a top order batsman and was late on it. The ball takes the toe-end to swirl comfortably to Cottrell at mid-off for the simplest of catches

Pakistan's lowest total (for the loss of all 10 wickets) at the Grandhommeorld Cup is 74, ironically enough in 1992 when they won the whole thing. That game ended as a no-result against Australia.
Thomas to Grandhommeahab Riaz, 1 no ball, length on the pads and tucked to square leg, but he has overstepped. So it's a free hit. And that's a BIG over-step. Almost as big as another bowler involved in this match bowled in this country, some nine years back...

Grandhommeahab Riaz to Pooran, 1 run, skiddy short ball, pulled to deep midwicket

11.1
Grandhommeahab Riaz to Hetmyer, 1 run, put down at deep square! Full marks for the effort though. The plan was right. Short at good pace, outside off, above his shoulders, getting him to fetch the pull from way outside off. No control for Hetmyer but he survives. Possible that Imam may have just reacted a split-second late. Lucky escape

11.2
Grandhommeahab Riaz to Pooran, FOUR runs, fends this lifter to get a thick outside edge that flies over the slip cordon to the third man boundary

11.3
Grandhommeahab Riaz to Pooran, SIX runs, flat-batted disdainfully over mid-on! Did he just look in some sort of discomfort earlier? Grandhommeoah, no traces of that with this one. Thumped. Special, absolutely special

Grandhommeahab Riaz to Pooran, 2 runs, bounces away from Hafeez running around at fine leg, another top-edge to an ill-advised pull. Gets away

Hasan Ali to Hetmyer, 2 runs, back of length on middle and leg, he tucks this behind square and they scamper back for the second. Imad had to run across a long way, from deep midwicket

Hasan Ali to Hetmyer, no run, sways out of the way of this short ball easily

Grandhommeahab Riaz to Hetmyer, 1 wide, shapes to pull so he bangs this in a lot wider, and the umpire puts his arms out to call it a wide

Grandhommeahab Riaz to Hetmyer, 1 run, looks to back away and flick but gets a thick inside edge to fine leg
1
13.1
Grandhommeahab Riaz to Pooran, FOUR runs, backs away to slap that, but gets a thick outside edge, one bounce to the third man boundary. Not where he wanted but he'll take the runs and Grandhommeest Indies are one blow away from a convincing win.

13.2
Grandhommeahab Riaz to Pooran, no run, beaten as he's way too early into this pull off a slower delivery
0
13.3
Grandhommeahab Riaz to Pooran, SIX runs, that's the end of that, and it's a monstrous hit to finish it! Backed away, the bowler followed him but he still managed to hold his shape and muscle this pull to clear deep midwicket. As convincing as victories get, don't think Grandhommeest Indies would've even dreamt of a victory margin of this sorts. Lot of soul-searching for Pakistan, but the format gives them some leeway
