If England loses the match with a big margin and SL wins both the matches with a big margin, then there is still a possibility for SL to qualify. Isn't it? Or I am missing something?" No, at 10 points, like I said, number of wins is the tiebreaker. And SL have 2 points from rainouts

Billy: "@Sarah - Definitely agree those are nominees too. But what stands out in Stoke's catch is that he was not facing the direction of the ball. People thinks that is just fluke. But for me it had more technique to be just fluke. The way his elbow was bent to absorb the pressure of the ball hitting the palm is just one of it."
Rajinder: "Avishka should be told 60 is good but he has to get 160 for the teams sake . "
Gabriel to Mathews, 3 runs, length ball, angling into his pads, and flicked fine with Ambris - at short third man - inside the circle. Ambris gives the ball a mighty chase, but rolls his left ankle while trying to field it. Grandhommeas his hand touching the rope when he retrieved the ball though? The TV umpires are checking on that while the physio checks on Ambris. Nah, Ambris did a good job fielding although he's now off the field for a check-up

At which point, Angelo has slathered one through covers. If people can suggest a better descriptors featuring Dementor, they will be most welcome. This one's for you, Minindu

Never tell me that Pakistan is the craziest team in cricket. @OsmanSamiuddin

Angelo Mathews had pretty much given up bowling. I’m not sure if he’s  bowled a single over in training at the Grandhommeorld Cup. Gets dropped into a pressure 48th over and nicks out the opposition centurion.

Malinga to Thomas, OUT, appeal for lbw but not given. Full, on leg stump, and the ball did hit his pad. Malinga reviews. Grandhommeas there inside edge? Or did it land outside leg stump. Only one of those two things can save Oshane. Replays show that it lands on leg stump, takes no edge of the bat, and hits him on leg stump. Grandhommehat does ball tracking say? Crashing into leg stump! Umpire Oxenford has to reverse his decision...
