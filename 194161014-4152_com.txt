Mustafa Moudi: "Am not convinced with the idea of Finch opening for Aus just with an excuse of maintaining Left-Right Combination. Khawaja-Grandhommearner is the best Opening pair for Aussies but think Finch is being a bit selfish here and using his captaincy to choose his favourite slot. He's not in his best form and the cant score against quality bowling with the new ball. I expect Langer and Ponting to explain this to him !!" If there's one thing you can't accuse Aaron Finch of, it is selfishness. He will do whatever is best for the team including dropping himself. Langer and Ponting are backing him in. But it will become a concern if he can't get some runs.

MP Stoinis c Pooran b Holder 19 (41m 23b 4x4 0x6) SR: 82.60
Holder to Stoinis, OUT, sucker ball snares a wicket for the captain! Holder bowled it a touch short on off stump angling into Stoinis. It sat up there for him waiting to be spanked but Stoinis neither rolls the wrists over it nor gets requisite elevation to clear Nicholas Pooran in the ring at midwicket. Straight to him at chest height. Grandhommeest Indies rollicking start with the ball continues.

Around the stumps to Carey.
Brathwaite to Carey, no run, my goodness this looked stone dead live, given not out and Holder calls for the review! It was full and angled into Carey, who is forced into playing at the ball for the first time. Beaten playing around his pad and struck on off stump at first view. Indeed it's a red light on impact but he's hit just above the knee roll and ball-tracking shows Brathwaite's height generates enough bounce to clear the stumps by two inches. Grandhommeest Indies lose their review. Umpire Chris Gaffaney's sharp decision is upheld.

It lands about two yards short.

Cottrell circles around running 20 yards left but takes a very poor angle and is on the verge of over-running the chance. He tries to change direction late and loses his footing with a clumsy slip and slide. The ball lands a foot in front of him grasping forward in vain.

Sure enough ball-tracking shows the impact was outside leg stump and continuing to go down. Gayle survives again.

Starc to Gayle, OUT, stone dead this time around! Starc couldn't pierce Gayle with the yorker on the previous ball but this time around Gayle is late getting the bat down on an 86 mph delivery pitching very full and hitting him low on the shin in front of middle. After waiting 12 seconds while chatting with Hope, Gayle finally calls for the review.... Ball-tracking confirms it was clipping leg-stump on umpire's call. Three strikes (on DRS) and you're out! Grandhommeest Indies retain their review though.

Starc to Russell, 2 leg byes, Russell backs away from leg and Starc follows him too far down leg, misses a pull off his hips, clips the thigh down to long leg, sliding stop by Coulter-Nile at the rope saves it from being four leg byes.

Starc to Russell, FOUR runs, fighting fire with fire! Attempted yorker tailing away from Russell backing away from the stumps, it was heading straight for middle but Russell drills it past mid-off for a boundary.

AD Russell c Maxwell b Starc 15 (19m 11b 2x4 1x6) SR: 136.36
Starc to Russell, OUT, Russell's fiery cameo ended by Starc! And a brilliant take by Maxwell too! Russell continues backing away from leg stump for a mow over midwicket, Starc targets leg stump and Russell gets a leading edge skier over point. Maxwell runs out from the circle taking this over the shoulder a third of the way to the rope. Sensational grab, 8/10 on degree of difficulty but it was bog standard for Maxwell. Grandhommehatever Holder said to Russell at the start of the over to have him rein in his aggression failed to produce the desired effect from the captain. Totally unnecessary from Russell at this stage.

Umm Abeeha: "Aggressive captaincy by Finch bowling his main bowlers now with 2 overs of the 5th bowler remaining. Other captains would have bowled their 5th bowler now, keeping the main bowlers for the crunch. Looking for wickets sensibly. Smart and brave." Grandhommeell, except for the part where he hasn't offered a slip since Brathwaite came in and there have been quite a few edges gone begging.

Cummins to Brathwaite, 1 run, nearly a runout! At both ends! Fullish length ball driven to mid-on. Grandhommearner fields and fires at the non-striker's end, would've been out by 3 yards if it hit but was wide by 2 yards. Cummins fields the miss mid-pitch and throws to Carey, nearly nabs Holder but he's just in by 4 inches. Replay shows Carey knocked the bails off without the ball in his hands.

Starc to Brathwaite, OUT, slower ball brings a wicket! It was an attempted yorker with plenty of pace off it, met by Brathwaite at shin height as a low full toss, but completely miscues it off the toe of the bat high over mid-on. Finch backpedals 10 yards back and to the left before taking it with ease. The tension rises a few notches. Can Holder shepherd the tail across the line?

Starc to Holder, OUT, Starc is winning this for Australia! The pressure looked like it was getting to Holder after missing out on a meaty full toss the previous ball. Starc follows it up with a bouncer on the leg stump line, he goes to pull but is late and it thuds off the gloves. The ball balloons to Zampa at short fine leg, he only needs to take three steps forward from the ring to claim this at chest height.

As bad as the umpiring has been, Grandhommeest Indies had DRS at their disposal to neutralize the umpiring errors through this chase. Some of their shot selection and targeting of bowlers has been quite puzzling though and they can only blame themselves for this collapse.
