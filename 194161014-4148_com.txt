England (Playing XI): Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(capt), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(wk), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood
Pakistan: Fakhar Zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Babar Azam, Mohammad Hafeez, Sarfaraz Ahmed (capt&wk), Shoaib Malik, Asif Ali, Shadab Khan, Hasan Ali, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Amir
Sarfaraz Ahmed: I wanted to bowl first too. It looks a good batting surface. The short-ball v West Indies was just a one-off I think. We have played five ODIs - not thinking about the losses.
Eoin Morgan: It [The pitch] looks very good. So, hopefully we play well enough today. We have one change: Liam Plunkett is out and Mark Wood comes in. It's because we want extra pace.
10am Morgan and Sarfaraz make their way out for the toss. England win the toss and choose to bowl
10.10am Wood lends extra pace and firepower to England's attack. Can he team up with Jofra Archer (your dream) and bounce out Pakistan like Oshane Thomas and co. had done a few days back? On that note, i'll hand over the World Cup cap and the controls to Danyal Rasool. And go say hello to Alan Gardner who will be manning the #livereport
Kash: "Is Sarfraz going to win ever a toss???" Or game, even. Who knows?
Jawad Ali: "I think Pakistan has done the mistake again here. They should have gone with Shaheed Afridi in place of Hassan. He was capable of providing variations and short balls. In the record score of 444 by england at this ground Hassan was the leading score consumer for Pakistan." There'll be plenty of time for negativity, but the game hasn't even started yet!
Thank you, Deiva, I'll take over now. So even if it is early into the tournament, Pakistan find themselves with a game that isn't quite must-win, but one where defeat will make the ones that follow especially so. For England, can anyone threaten their inexorable march to the title? More importantly, can Pakistan?
Right, the anthems are done, the goosebumps have tingled and then faded away, and now it's about how Pakistan bat (against a bouncer barrage, probably). Imam and Fakhar walking out to the middle.

END OF OVER:11 | 4 Runs | PAK: 73/0 | RR: 6.63
George Dobell: Did England miss a trick not opening the bowling with Mark Wood? Certainly the prospect of Wood and Archer in tandem is attractive. It's quite rare for England to have two 90+ mph bowlers in the same team (when was the last time? Harmison and Flintoff, perhaps?) and Wood might well have enjoyed the hardness of the new ball every bit as much as Archer. But England reasoned that, if anyone was to get these new white balls to move, it would probably be Woakes. And perhaps he doesn't have the other weapons - in particular the pace - to compensate once the balls are a little older. Archer, meanwhile, looks especially dangerous to left-handers, so it probably made sense to give him the other new ball. As it happened, Woakes gained little - if any - movement, though he did generate more pace than he has managed for a while. He touched 90 mph himself at one stage. Bringing on Wood - who might well be just a little quicker than Archer - as second change also offers a bit of bite in the bowling just as other sides might be introducing their medium-pacers and should keep the batsmen on their toes.

Danyal Rasool: England's bowling to Fakhar has either been poorly planned or poorly executed. Teams generally figured out the best way to get him out was cramp him outside the off stump channel. Other than Woakes in the first over, that's never really happened. And too many balls have fallen right inside his arc.
Fakhar Zaman st â€ Buttler b Ali 36 (63m 40b 6x4 0x6) SR: 90.00
Ali to Fakhar Zaman, OUT, Moeen finds grip and turn! Buttler takes the bails off and thinks he has his man. This was a beauty from Moeen. Drifts in from round the wicket. The flight draws the batsman out of his crease. The ball dips, creating distance between the bat and the pitch of the ball. The turn takes it past the bat and Buttler does the rest. Fakhar closes his bat-face and prods at it limply. The TV umpire has been called in to have a look at this. Fakhar can't drag his back foot back in time. Moeen provides England with the breakthrough
W
14.1
George Dobell: That stumping might be relevant. There's been just a little concern about Jos Buttler's keeping of late. He wasn't at his best - or anywhere near it - at The Oval and he has been working pretty hard on it in training. But he completed that neatly and quickly and will, no doubt, feel a bit better for it.

Bhargav Sura: "I am a person who believes in data. OK - Mark Wood can be bowling fast. But if his inability to take wickets is blocking Plunkett or Wiley from playing, then I think England are making bad decision. It is just like Bhuvi in Indian team. He bowls economically, but cannot take wickets. Plus Bhuvi's bowling average is much less than Wood thanks' to his economy, so he is needed in the Indian team to contain the batters. Wood's average and economy are obviously not that great."

Looks like Mark Wood is returning to the attack
Wood to Mohammad Hafeez, SIX runs, slightly legsidish, but chipped from Hafeez. What a chip, though! Excellent timing, right off the middle of the bat. No power whatsoever but struck it so cleanly it goes over the short boundary.

Wood to Mohammad Hafeez, OUT, gorgeously struck but it's straight to Chris Woakes at long-off! England were desperate for that wicket. Well hit, but failed to manoeuvre the bat face effectively, and as a consequence it goes straight to the man in that catching position, and Pkaistan lose their fourth

Bibin Baby: "Could we see the first century of this WC atleast today? Too long a wait it has been this time around." Now look who's jinxed it.

Archer to Asif Ali, 2 runs, Asif's first ball flicked to the onside. A suicidal two, and a direct hit would have had Sarfaraz packing

Archer to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 2 runs, another mishit shot pays off. No timing means it doesn't carry to long-on, and the batsmen scuttle another couple. England keeping the boundaries at bay, though.

Archer to Sarfaraz Ahmed, FOUR runs, smart thinking from Sarfaraz. Picked up what the bowler was trying to do, and only had to clear mid-off

Archer to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 4 runs, oh, dear, what's happening to England?!! They're in a bit of disarray in the field. Sarfaraz sliced the ball to point, who threw it at the stumps without a man backing up in the same post code. It goes all the way to the boundary!

Wood to Asif Ali, OUT, and that spells the end of Asif. Cleared his front leg and smeared it to deep cover. It went straight to Bairstow, who lets out a growl of part-joy, part frustration. He'll have to knock off these runs, you know.

2.49pm Hello again, everyone. Thanks, Danyal. YJB and Roy - who didn't quite have a great day in the field - walk out to open England's 349 chase. Pakistan will open with legspin in the form of Shadab Khan. Danny got his strategic punts right in his preview, didn't he? Tahir was the one who dismissed YJB with the new ball in the WC opener.

Shadab Khan to Roy, OUT, Shadab pins Roy in front. The finger goes up, but Roy opts to challenge the on-field out decision. This looks pretty plumb, though. Pushed through on middle, Roy stretches out for a sweep, but this is too full for the shot. Has Roy snicked it? Nah, no bat involved and the UltraEdge confirms it. The tracker returns three reds and Roy has to go. It would have crashed into off stump. Tahir had got Bairstow early in the WC opener. Shadab now gets Roy. The departing batsman, however, isn't particularly happy. He has a word with umpire Erasmus before trudging off. Legspin with the new ball is England's Achilles heel

Kuldeep: "Hope Pakistan wins this.

Srinath at our stats team tells us why England are so good. "An indication of why England's batting depth is so highly rated: since the start of 2016, teams have chased down this equation only 15% of the time. Our Forecaster is still giving them a 37% chance from here."

40.1
Shadab Khan to Ali, no run, Sarfaraz, what have you done? Dropped. Shadab slips in a googly, starts on middle, and breaks away sharply. Moeen leaves his crease, closes the bat-face, pokes limply, falls over and edges it behind, but Sarfaraz isn't quick enough to close his gloves around it. Big deflection. Big chance missed

Mukund: "Should Pak gamble by giving another over to Shoaib Malik? Dont think it would be a bad idea to spring a surprise at England."
Hasan Ali to Ali, 3 runs, pretty full and outside off, Moeen isn't eager to press forward. He hangs back instead and scoops it away in the air between mid-off and cover. Wahab chases the ball hard, slides near the boundary, and hauls it back in

Mohd Amir to Buttler, no run, short of a length and slanting away outside off, Buttler has a flash... and misses

Mohd Amir to Buttler, FOUR runs, Hundred for Jos the boss. He brings up the landmark off 75 balls. This was pitched up and wide outside off, Buttler reaches out for the ball and shovels it away with the bottom hand in the air to the left of mid-off. This is England's fastest World Cup hundred. Top innings from a top batsman. Will it turn out to be a match-winning knock?

JC Buttler c Wahab Riaz b Mohd Amir 103 (103m 76b 9x4 2x6) SR: 135.52
Mohd Amir to Buttler, OUT, Amir fools Buttler with an offcutter and wheels away. Pakistan are still in this. Amir ensures they're still in this. This is the variation - the offcutter that is short and swerves away outside off. The extra bounce means Buttler can't line this up. He slashes and top-edges it into the lap of short third man

Mohd Amir to Ali, FOUR runs, slower short ball on middle, Moeen lines it up and swats a pull away to the left of deep square leg. Imam dives in vain and watches it whistle away to the boundary. First boundary for Moeen. Has he found his groove at the right time for England? Sarfraz isn't pleased with Amir's length

Wahab Riaz to Ali, OUT, Wahab takes down Moeen with a slower bouncer. Sarfaraz and Wahab in the middle of an animated chat. Good variation from Wahab and he bangs it in outside off.

Wahab Riaz to Woakes, OUT, What a double-blow from Wahab. Welcome back, Wahab! Coach Arthur enjoyed that. He claps away in glee. Wahab roars and pumps his fist. These emotions tell you the story. That's how you prove your coach wrong. After the slower one, Wahab hits 87mph and finds extra bounce. Banged in short and zipping away, Woakes flashes and the edge flies through to the keeper. Sarfaraz takes the ball over his head
