De Kock looks to cut, but gets a thin edge that is put down. Clearly nervous, he takes off for a run but is left high and dry as Markram doesn't move. Mushfiqur has the presence of mind to run quickly to his right, pick up the ball and hit the stumps at the striker's end to catch him well short. Brain fade from de Kock.

Mustafizur Rahman to Duminy, no run, Mustafizur has turned this game bigtime, or has he? Given out and JP Duminy reviews. Cuts back in from outside off on a length, JP is hurried into a defensive stroke which he tries to execute from the crease, but it's the fizz (no pun intended) that does him in. Hit high on the pad but mind you he was rooted to the crease and the ball didn't have much distance to travel. Clear gap between bat and pad, only thing to see was if it would've hit the stumps. Ball tracking says no so the original decision has been reversed. Huge relief for South Africa
