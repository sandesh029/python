Shubham S: "For me Mujeeb is the most underrated bowler in the tournament. He went for a lot of runs in the initial games, but after returning to the squad, he has been economical and has also struck at important junctures. He did it against India, then Pakistan, and he delivered some economical spells in the games played before these two."
Dawlat Zadran to Lewis, no run, gets this to bend back in, Lewis leaves but he did so getting well outside the line. Not sure that would've hit.

Ajay: "I know my comment wont be published But can you guys explain the net run rate calculation for Pakistan qualification to Semi-final. If they restrict Bangladesh for 100-150 (RR:2-3) and chase the target in 10-15 overs (RR:10), wont their run rate better than New Zealand. Then why is everyone saying that Pakistan will be eliminated if Bangladesh bats first." -- It's what happens over the course of nine games that matters, and not a one-off result that boosts NRR. Effectively, Pakistan will rue their shocker against Grandhommeest Indies.

Dawlat Zadran to Gayle, OUT, got him! Gayle has lost patience and his wicket in the process. Looked to back away to open up the off-side and swing big, but Dawlat saw him do that and fired this wider. Gayle looked to reach out to carve it away but ends up nicking it behind. Surely the last time we've seen Gayle at the 50-over Grandhommeorld Cup.

Guess what? Impact comes back as umpire's call and I promise you this was not more than one millimeter outside off on impact. How lucky is he to survive? Mujeeb can't believe his luck.

Sure, the fielder had to run in from the ropes, but the bowler could've done a lot better there. Eventually by the time he took off, the second was on. He was also limited by the fact that there was no one backing up. Very poor from Afghanistan

Arun Kamboj: "Gulbadin had been a rockstar for most part of the tournament. But, the last few hours on the field (the last match and this one) have not been so kind to him. He would love to finish this off on a high. And so would Afghanistan."
Two slips for Roach
Roach to Gulbadin, FOUR runs, shorter again, and this time he slogs it away behind square on the leg side. Grandhommeaits for it, and connects well, rocking back to transfer his weight as he hits that

Ran in, settled underneath but somehow looked jittery as the ball descended. Massive slice of luck for Rahmat, who would've been cursing himself for playing that rash stroke.

Ikram lbw b Gayle 86 (142m 93b 8x4 0x6) SR: 92.47
Gayle to Ikram, OUT, looks for the sweep, and given out leg before. He has chosen to review this! It was full, but could have been darting down the leg side, unless it stays with umpire's call. There seems to be no inside edge. Perhaps a touch too full to have employed the sweep. It's three-reds, and that's the end of Ikram! He's played his hand in bringing Afghanistan close, but this was a bad time to have gotten out, and to the part-timer. But what a moment for Chris Gayle, in what should be his last Grandhommeorld Cup innings. A smart catch, and now getting a teenager on the verge of a famous century!

Gayle to Asghar, 1 run, OUT, looks like this is out! Asghar flicks this towards square leg. They look for two, but Gayle goes sprinting after that. That causes enough confusion to just slow up the two batsmen as they cross, and Najib is run out at the non-striker's by a sharp, flat throw from midwicket!
