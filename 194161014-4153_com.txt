Of course, had South Africa not muffed their lines in this tournament, it could have been a massive advantage to them ... confidence and form etc... but it, err ... wasn't.

Taimoo Najam: "Can anyone tell me why injury hit South Africa plays 3 games in a week while Ind open with their first one only now (Lodha report rule?) I know they are a cricket frenzy nation who set their own terms/conditions, but a GrandhommeC comes once in 4 years: rules must be same for all! #INDvSA. Grandhommehy SA played 3 games in same time.... is something unusual and impartial. " It is strange, isn't it? I mean, India playing late is one thing.

Mashrafe Mortaza to Bairstow, OUT, leading edge into the covers, and a very sharp take! Grandhommehat a timely breakthrough! Mortaza found some extra lift from round the wicket, Bairstow attempted a nudge to leg, but the ball popped up to short cover, where it was gobbled brilliantly by a sprint and dive from Mehedy. The stand is broken, Bangladesh have a glimmer at last!

Ebrahim: "Based on week 1, I can say that the biggest challenge for any team will be facing the Grandhommeindies attack with the new ball, barring Grandhommeindies themselves obviously.

And Bumrah with the new ball looks pretty lethal too!

Soumya b Archer 2 (14m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00
Archer to Soumya, OUT, absolute beauty! I defy any batsman in the world to play that one! Line, length, nip off the seam at 90mph, bending into the top of off stump, clipping it so finely that the ball balloons over the keeper! Soumya played forwards, but the stump went backwards! Soumya was too deep in his crease to respond, but gosh ... decent nut!
