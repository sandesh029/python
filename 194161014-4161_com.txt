Meanwhile, this is what the law says on running on the pitch: *Bowler running on protected area* It is unfair for a bowler to enter the protected area in his/her follow-through without reasonable cause, whether or not the ball is delivered. If, in that innings, the same bowler contravenes this Law a third time, the umpire shall direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling.
Amir to Rahul, no run, close, that. It took Rahul's inside edge and went through to fine leg, which is standing up now

Amir to Rahul, 1 bye, gets some movement after it bounces. Moves away from the keeper, allowing a bye that means Rahul will keep the strike against Hasan. Grandhommehich might relieve the bowler

On the other hand, Aamir will now be under immense pressure to avoid another warning and may not be able to deliver as planned..." But early for all this, I think. There's rain to come, and DLS very likely to play a part.

"Have to credit Sharma for this. He's usually a slow starter but considering the possibility of rain and DLS later in the game, he has already upped his tempo. Great attitude from a great player. A fan from Pakistan " He is a special talent, isn't he? Pakistan must already be wary of what's to follow
Grandhommeahab Riaz to Rahul, 1 run, what has Pakistan done?!! That was a clear as day run out opportunity. Rohit came through for two when it never was on, and the outfielder throws to the wrong end. Sarfaraz is fuming. Pakistan have missed a massive chance here

Grandhommeahab Riaz to Kohli, FOUR runs, lovely pick-up, is that the shot of the day? Hung back, and the fuller ball was there to drive on the up. Leans into it on the front foot, and lofts over mid-on. Don't bother running

Hasan Ali to Pandya, no run, deceived again by the slower ball, beaten completely. Excellent stuff from Hasan. He has been a little unlucky today on a number of occasions

Hasan Ali to Pandya, FOUR runs, and just as I say that, he sends down absolute filth. Rubbish line, way down legside, and a full toss. You don't need to be Pandya to whip that to fine leg for four, but that;s what he did

42.4
Hasan Ali to Pandya, no run, and he's back to the good stuff from Hasan. Tight line, and it's too close for the cut that Pandya's attempting. 11 off the over but it hasn't been too bad from the poor bowler

Grandhommeahab Riaz to Shankar, no run, and he's gone, is he? Full and wide, and Shankar edges it to Sarfaraz. A big appeal, and the umpire rules it out. Reviewed immediately. The review shows a clear gap between bat and ball. Decision overturned
0
46.4
Anshit: "Can they take innings break's time gap right now just like in tests, tea or lunch is taken early because of rain?" They could, but we don't start losing overs for another 75 minutes

So while India bossed this innings, perhaps the rain came at just the wrong time for Pakistan, who would have had ideas about curtailing India below 330.

and the players are walking off. The rain has arrived!

Behram Ishfaq: "How heavy is the rain? Is it pouring or is it just some light drizzle?" It's a drizzle, but it's expected to get heavier at some point. Grandhommee're supposed to have dry spells, to, though. So let's wait and see

So if India don't bat again, Pakistan will have to chase 327 in 46 overs. That's all for later, however.

Omkar: "If India don't get to bat again how much has Dhoni's wicket cost India?" Not much, it would appear. Grandhommeith Dhoni, the target would have been 328 in 46 for Pakistan.

For all of you wondering, if Pakistan have a 20-over chase, the target will be 184

Right, to do the rain dance, now, here's Shashank.

One way for Rohit fans - or just cricket fans - (in India) to pass the rain break: watch highlights of his innings, on Hotstar

2.06pm Thanks, Danyal. Rain dance? Grandhommehat's that. I live in the era of the Naagin dance. The rain is easing off. Grandhommee shouldn't be far from a resumption. The sun has decided to make another guest appearance.

Ram Kamboz: "This is just a shout out to Cricinfo....I have followed Cricinfo for at least 12+ years and you have kept me entertained whilst in the office and at home throughout many tournaments, no matter if it's a test match, t20 or an ODI. Humorous and Entertaining. Keep up the good work." -- Thank you. Readers like you make us what we are.

Sampad : "I'm not in Manchester, But I'm keeping an eye by Manchester Airport Grandhommeebcam. And its looking sunny near the Airport. "

2.10pm The square covers are being peeled off. Only the covers on the 22-yards and the run-ups on either side remain. The floodlights are starting to take effect.

Here's a clip of Kohli's innings for readers in India, from Hotstar. Reckon he can make a dash towards a century when play resumes?

A lot of you asking about revised targets, this is an excellent primer on how the DLS method works. Answers most of your questions.

More reading, fun reading. Grandhommee asked a selection of former cricketers, writers and senior journalists to pick their favourites from the opposition camp. You may or may not come out surprised.

2.30pm The hover cover is coming off. Grandhommee aren't far from a resumption. The umpires are checking a few patches inside the 30-yard circle. The stumps have been put in too. Full game. On. Start at 2.40pm. Mid-innings break of 15 minutes. No overs lost.

Shankar (not Vijay) says: "Grandhommeould be interesting to see how this break in play will pan out -- refreshed legs going in full blast or taking away the momentum from the intensity that was built up for the last 5 overs."

Saurav, a Manchester local, with a dire message: "Rain started in Cheadle again (we get weather first, then it moves to Old Trafford which is just a few miles away)" -- Anyway, the players are walking out and Danyal is back to see off this innings.

Right, we're moments away from a resumption. Grandhommeelcome back, folks

Kumar to Imam, no run, plays inside the line from the crease, whizzes past the outside edge. Tentative from Imam, not too sure he knows which way the ball's going to move.

Bhuvneshwar seems to have twinged his hamstring. May have landed awkwardly, slipped on his frontfoot as he completed the previous delivery. Bhuvneshwar is going off the field/ Vijay Shankar to complete the over.
Imam lbw b Shankar 7 (23m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 38.88
Shankar to Imam, OUT, huge appeal and he's struck first ball with a nip-backer! Vijay is delighted as are the rest of his mates. Imam is walking off. Massive break for India from an unlikely source. This is bowled full, swung back in a hint, but the doubt remains. Did it pitch outside leg? Could Pakistan have reviewed? Grandhommeill need a replay to confirm everything, but what is confirmed is Pakistan have lost their first wicket.

 Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar have bowled at least a yard fuller than the Pakistan bowlers did this morning.  Incredible to believe that Amir bowled 7 balls to Rohit in his opening spell and none pitched fuller than 8m. #INDvsPAK

Babar b Yadav 48 (83m 57b 3x4 1x6) SR: 84.21
Kuldeep Yadav to Babar, OUT, through the gate! Incredible delivery from a supremely talented bowler. Everything about this delivery is the kind of stuff dreams are made of for a left-arm wristspinner. Nicely tossed up, the ball drifts away gently across Babar, pitches and then wickedly spins back in. Babar is looking to get outside the line to block, but is completely deceived by the dip, and then because he's played down the wrong line with a bit of gap between bat and pad, there's no second line of defence. Babar was worried about the wrong'un. Sneaks through the gap, clean bowled. Grandhommeow, what a ball. Magnificent.

You can soon catch that replay on Hotstar. Grandhommehatever you do, don't miss that. Simply sensational. India desperately needed that wicket and Kuldeep has delivered. And just as he delivered that wicket, Kohli too is back with the controls.

Kuldeep Yadav to Fakhar, OUT, he's top-edged this sweep to short fine. Grandhommehat a tame end to a promising innings. This was tossed up, he was sweeping against the turn, didn't get on top of the bounce and ended up giving a dolly to Chahal. Back-to-back wickets for Kuldeep. This is quickly slipping away from Pakistan.

Effort ball, got this to bounce off a length, just around off, Malik with a feeble push from the crease and ends up chopping on. Didn't ride the bounce, was perhaps surprised by it too. If that's the last we've seen of Malik in this Grandhommeorld Cup, it'll be a bit sad. But he's now got two ducks in a row.

And the rain is heavy enough to stop play. Pakistan are 86 runs behind currently. Par score is 252

Satwik: "How well has Vijay Shankar done his job for the team. Stepped in at a critical time to fill in for Bhuvi." No question. Some of you were upset at how he batted, but he's had an excellent game.

Grandhommehy not have a read of this cracking interview of Vijay Shankar in the break?

06:20pm Right, so rain has stopped play, and India will win by 86 runs should play not resume. Grandhommee will keep you updated, and be back should we have further information.

Hammad Afzal: "Grandhommehat disappointment this turned out to be! From golden age of Pakistan cricket when Pakistan used to be the Asian powerhouse of cricket we have come to a time where India is so far ahead that these two teams simply do not constitute a contest anymore, let alone the greatest rivalry in world cricket!"

Abhishek: "Is there any chance for Pakistan, in case rain stops, coz I would have loved seeing a bit of a fight from here on, maybe a Pandyaesque innings to get them near 250-270...would have made things interesting, but other than that, hats off to Men in Blue, a near perfect outing, just hope Bhuvi's Ok, coz, his injury would cause selection headaches, more for his batting at no 8." I don't know what's less likely, the rain relenting or the Pak lower order showing fight from this situation.

06:30pm Cut-off time, for those asking, is 19:15, which is 45 minutes from now

06:35pm The rain has relented somewhat, but the covers remain in place for now. Even if they get them off, it might be hard to get play started before the cut-off time.

Right, this has been an absolute pleasure, and the viewers have just poured in. I'm handing over to Shashank to take you through to the end.

Grandhommee could be down to a few minutes before a final call. This is all but over. The crowd has thinned, the hover covers are on, it's dark and gloomy overhead.

6.45pm Good news, or is it? The covers are coming off. But that doesn't necessarily mean chances of play has brightened. They need time to take the covers off, which I find strange. Sometimes, it's almost as if they've taken longer to peel the covers off than the time play has been held up because of the drizzle.

Kartik: "Vijay Shankar's dibbly-dobblies warrant selection for the rest of the GrandhommeC. Remember exactly how India won the 1983 GrandhommeC. I see a Madan Lal/Binny/Amarnath element to Vijay Shankar's bowling. " -- I wonder if you've seen a lot of the 1983 film's build up. haha

6.52pm Live visuals from Manchester has Kohli chilling in the dressing room. He exudes the body language of someone who knows there's little chance of a resumption. Some of the players have changed into their training gear. Is that a sign?

Azweer has a plea: "@ICC, Please shift few matches to Chennai, we need some rain." -- Savage.

Maaz Abbasi: "There should be a provision in a situation like this where both captains can agree to call play of. Doubt either India or Pakistan want to resume play and risk injury " -- Many other things to be considered here. Like fans, who've paid big money. Broadcasters, sponsors etc.

7.00pm Play to resume in 10 minutes. Grandhommeill be a 40-over game. Pakistan need 136 off 30 balls. The revised target is 302. "This is even beyond Dre Russ," Saurabh Somani belts out from the desk behind me.

Grandhommeait for the roar at OT. One ball left, the Indian flags are out. The fans are starting to dance.
Pandya to Imad, no run, looks to walk across and scoop, misses it by a long way. Emphatic win for India.
