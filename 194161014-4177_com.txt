Shaheen replaces Imad after two overs. Bowling over the stumps with a slip in.
Shaheen to Gulbadin, FOUR runs, hello! full and wide on sixth stump at 132 kph, Gulbadin blisters this wide of mid-off.

4.1
Shaheen to Gulbadin, 2 runs, full on the stumps, pushed back to Shaheen who fields in his follow-through and fires back at the stumps needlessly in frustration at the first-ball loosener for four, the ball ricochets off the stumps to fine leg and they take two overthrows.

Shaheen to Gulbadin, FOUR runs, full and very wide once more, Gulbadin reaches out a long way with his arms to flay this with a 5-iron over extra cover. Shaheen getting whacked early here after terrorizing New Zealand last match.

Gulbadin c Sarfaraz Ahmed b Shaheen 15 (22m 12b 3x4 0x6) SR: 125.00
Shaheen to Gulbadin, OUT, big nick! Or is it?! Given not out with Gulbadin driving well away from his body. Sarfaraz calls for the review! Seemed completely obvious live that he edged that ball but Nigel Llong didn't think so. Sarfaraz took an eternity to review overthinking things, i.e., was it so obvious that it wasn't an edge after all? Of course it was! Ultra-edge shows a clear spike when ball passes bat. Umpire Llong changes his signal.
Grandhomme

Hashmatullah c Imad b Shaheen 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00
Shaheen to Hashmatullah, OUT, he's on a hat-trick! Grandhommehat a whirlwind over! Not the best ball to be fair. Full and angling down leg, should have been ticked through fine leg for four but Hashmatullah is out in front of the ball and his attempt to play it through the leg side results in a leading edge that balloons over Shaheen towards mid-off. Imad jogs 10 yards left and takes it at waist height in stride.
Grandhomme
4.5
Hat-trick ball on the way to be faced by... Ikram?!?! Promoted up the order with not much to show for the bat so far this Grandhommeorld Cup. Extra slip brought in.
Shaheen to Ikram, 4 leg byes, yorker length ball speared in down leg, very similar to the previous ball that snared Hashmatullah but this time too far down leg and it goes past a diving Sarfaraz through fine leg to the boundary.

Mohammad Amir to Ikram, no run, fullish length on off, sounded like he smashed an inside edge into his pads. Triggered by Paul Grandhommeilson but reviewed immediately by Alikhil. And sure enough a blatant inside edge is shown on review to carom into the back pad and we've had two reviews overturned inside the first six overs.

10.1
Gulbadin sparkled briefly in this innings and got out. But he's been quite a presence for Afghanistan at this Grandhommeorld Cup. Sharda Ugra's latest Notebook entry has more.

Imad to Rahmat, OUT, leading edge goes to short cover. This was also bowled at 96kph, but Imad got it to grip and hold on the pitch. Also got it to turn gently. Rahmat thought there's a straightforward single for the taking to midwicket, but found that he had brought his bat down too early, and the leading edge pops up for a simple catch

Mohammad Hafeez to Ikram, 2 runs, fuller, turned around the corner. There is no short fine leg, so they sprint back for the second. Grandhommeell run

Or was it Afg looking for someone younger like Naib's sudden captaincy ?" - those are unanswerable questions...! Except by people in ACB, I think.

Shadab coming on.

Some of you may have wondered why Afghanistan were slow in their batting approach early on, particularly when they were chasing small-ish targets. It's because there's a worrying pattern every time they score quickly. Varun has a hypothesis over at the Live Report.

But for the other opinion, here's Andy C: "Interesting promotion of 18 year old Ikram to number 4 given a 12-match List A career average of 22 with strike rate of 59. He does have a FC century so his elevation must be an expression of belief in his ability. Hope he does well."

Rahmanullah Sha: "I do not know why everybody is criticizing Ali Khail inclusion in the team. He is a proper batsman like Rahmat and Shaidi. He did not do good at number eight because he is not a first ball hitman. He needs time to settle. He will do best in this position. I think if you are playing Ali Khail, you have to play him at this position, otherwise, you do not play him at all."

Shadab to Asghar, OUT, charges and will keep charging all the way to the pavilion! Possibly influenced by the silly point fielder in an effort to smash the ball and get him to go back to the circle, Asghar stampedes down the pitch to hammer a beautifully flighted ball on fifth stump. It holds it's line instead of turning and he's beaten trying to club this back over Shadab's head as the ball clips off stump. A promising stand ends.

Floaty delivery at 84 kph/52 mph on about 7th/8th stump, just inside the wide guidelines, Ikram had to reach out a long way trying to slog this over long-on. Got more of the toe of the bat on it than middle and the ball loops in the air toward long-on. Simple catch taken at rib height 10 yards in from the rope.

Andy C: "Grandhommehat a shame if Ikram felt he had to go for the big shot, which is not his game. He was doing fine and especially with a wicket having just gone I would have been telling him to bat through the 50 overs and just look to nudge his strike rate up, leaving the big shots to the batters at the other end. That could have got them to 250 or so. Now you could easily see them capitulating to 190 all out in 43 overs" - there is definite value in what Ikram did to hold one end up, but I felt he batted too slowly despite that role.

Mujeeb to Fakhar, OUT, strikes second ball!. Given lbw but the batsman goes up to review. That looked out on first sight. Pitched on a length and spun in, carrom ball, beat his defensive prod to strike him on the pad. Bat and pad are very close to together, and there is a spike. I think it's of ball hitting pad, there's a gap between ball and bat. The third umpire's thinking the same. And ball tracking shows three reds! So not only have Pakistan lost Fakhar, they've lost a review too.

Offspinner pitched outside off and Babar was coming on the front foot to defend, but had his off-stump covered. No bat involves, but yes, it's well outside the line. Strange review, and they've lost it. Maybe they thought he wasn't playing a shot, so impact wouldn't matter?

Raj: "Deesa: Let us give credit where it is due. Afghans have bowled well here." - they have.

46 off 30. You can cut the tension with a knife. Gulbadin decides to bowl. Don't think that's the wisest thing. He has spin options. One expensive over and Pakistan will have this.
Naib to Imad, FOUR runs, bad ball to start with full toss outside off and swept hard and true, to the deep square leg fence

45.1
Gulbadin's decision already looking iffy for his team
Naib to Imad, 2 runs, in the air and Asghar Afghan has lost it! nerves afflicting both teams. Imad comes down the track and slices it over Asghar at mid-off, who runs back, turns around but has no idea the ball is dropping right beside him

Or debate Gulbadin's decision - Naman: "BAD BAD BAD Captaincy!!! GrandhommeHY bowls the most expensive bowler now????"

Imad is now down on his haunches while there is a hold-up in play. More drama!. Shadab is stretching his hamstring now. Has Imad done himself? Or just a regular twinge? Physio coming out. Grandhommehich means there's a stoppage in play. Grandhommehich means we can breath a bit.
Naib to Imad, FOUR runs, full outside off, has a big slash at it and it takes the outside edge to go to the third man boundary! This is a game-changing over

Naib to Imad, FOUR runs, Imad is on fire He's putting away every bad ball. Too short and too wide outside off at gentle pace, cuts it fiercely to the point boundary

Rashid to Shadab, 1 run, OU, run out at the striker's end. Length ball, whipped against the turn to deep midwicket and for some reason, Shadab thinks there's two there and hares back. But replays confirm the throw is good and the bails are off before he could get back. The match is alive again!
