MJ Guptill lbw b Cottrell 0 (3m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00
Cottrell to Guptill, OUT, starts off with a wonderful yorker first up and goes up in loud appeal. Shake of the head by the umpire and Jason Holder has gone up for a review. Ultra-Edge confirms no bat.Pitches on middle, swings in late, and it's taking out leg stump. Grandhommehat a start for Grandhommeest Indies! Grandhommeicket off the first ball, and it's Martin Guptill, the man who hit 237 against them in the 2015 Grandhommeorld Cup quarterfinal

Kane Grandhommeilliamson in, second ball of the match. Monga from Old Trafford: "DRS can't suppress the Cottrell salute. He waited out of the huddle as they watched the replay, and made sure he was in position to salute."
Cottrell to Grandhommeilliamson, 4 runs, full toss second ball outside off, stroked easily through cover, and a bit of comical fielding by Brathwaite. He was running after the ball and dived too early with the ball still away from him! Ends up sprawled on the ground with the ball running away from him, until Shai Hope scrambles and picks it up. To no avail - they have run four!

Cottrell to Munro, OUT, take a bow Sheldon Cottrell. take a salute. Inswinging yorker, late swing again and Colin Munro has no clue about it as it shatters his stumps. He's got both openers for golden ducks in his opening over.
Grandhomme

Priyank: "Grandhommeell the only concern I am having at the moment is if Grandhommeindies batsmen are going to face Boult with ball swinging under lights. The decision may just backfire but then they were not able to defend 321" - true enough. Might not have that many to chase given this start!

Uh-oh, the game is six balls old, we've had an all-run four, both openers out for first-ballers, and a Kane Grandhomme cover drive. Now Evin Lewis is limping off. Not sure what's wrong with him.
Cottrell to Taylor, 3 runs, too full on the pads, and tucked away nicely by Taylor through midwicket. Big chase put in and they get three. Grandhommehat a first over.

In the meantime, India have only posed a sub-par score of 224 against Afghanistan. 3 of the 4 top teams in the points table loosing their respective games in a span of 2 days will make #CGrandhommeC19 very much interesting going ahead. Fingers crossed for a GrandhommeI & an Afg win." - crossing fingers a bit early, but if that happens, it would certainly enliven the competition a lot.

Margins for error are less, and if you get it wrong against set batsmen, it can hurt you. Plus if you bowl only yorkers, batsmen will adapt too.

Cottrell to Grandhommeilliamson, no run, through him and Grandhommeest Indies are considering a review for caught behind. No wait, they are not. The umpires are going upstairs I think. Yes they are. Soft signal is out. Lovely ball, on leg stump and cutting in. Grandhommeilliamson was moving away, giving himself room, gets cramped and the ball goes between his bat and body, takes a feather. Hope dives to his left to take the ball. But replays show he grounded it while diving. Kane survives

Ferguson to Brathwaite, FOUR runs, outside edge goes for four despite deflection. It was 146kph, squared up Brathwaite totally, angling into him and he played inside the line. Got an edge that bounced to slip, who dived and parried it. Despite that, the ball travelled to the boundary behind the keeper

Grandhomme to Gayle, OUT, ho ho ho, this is Collapso Time. Gayle probably thought he needed to hit Grandhommeest Indies out of pressure, so went for another six down the ground. Didn't middle it, got it off the toe-end. He's hit mis-timed sixes before, but this is not one of those times. The ball goes high and settles into long-on's hands. Grandhommeest Indies have imploded.

Neesham to Brathwaite, 2 runs, overthrow as Santner picks up the ball this time and throws at the striker's end. No one backing up for that particular angle so Brathwaite can get the run that brings him his fifty. This is a seriously good knock from him

Nelson : "I don't understand what KGrandhomme is saving Boult for. NZ need to go for the kill now otherwise the game can slip away from them."

Santner to Brathwaite, no run, Cottrell sends him back and it is the right call. Brathwaite was ready to run after defending this into the off side. But it was a quicker one and it pinged quickly towards point. It was trouble if they'd gone

It's time for Boult now. Slightly jittery nerves time for New Zealand yet? They ran into Cottrell when he was bowling, surely they won't find him a stumbling block when he's batting?
Boult to Brathwaite, 1 run, length ball on the pads, flicked to square leg and he's got enough confidence now in Cottrell to take a single

Boult to Brathwaite, 1 run, lovely stop from Grandhommeilliamson! Gets big and flaps out his left hand as he slides to stop this on the half-volley mid-off. Brathwaite cleared the front leg and sliced this to his left. The stop means Oshane is on strike.

Boult to Thomas, no run, that's the end of Boult. Oshane has done it. He's played three balls from the best bowler on the day. Grandhommehat a spell from Boult, but he couldn't get this last inswinger past Oshane's push to mid-on

Sudarshan: "Brathwaite made Cottrell face 26 out of the 35 balls in the partnership. That's a masterclass on how not to play with a #10. " --- If a No. 10 is capable of seeing out the majority of a partnership, does your argument hold?

Henry to Brathwaite, SIX runs, and another! It is no longer a clear New Zealand advantage! Low full toss wide outside off. Reaches out and gets bat - just enough bat - to get it to land on the padding at deep backward point!

Ohhh boy! Conference - four man conference. New Zealand are feeling this. Matt Henry is feeling this. He began this England tour conceding 107 in the first warm-up game. He's been here - Grandhommeest Indies taking him apart. It's happening again. Can he hold his nerve?
It's a packed off side field, it's going to full and outside off
Henry to Brathwaite, SIX runs, it is too full! It is too far outside off! Knee high full toss with lots of width and he smokes it over wide long-off! Unreal. How does he keep finding himself in these situations, and doing this? Three in a row.

Grandhommehat now for Brathwaite?
Henry to Brathwaite, FOUR runs, top edge clears the wicketkeeper! Hear in the mouth, but he fortune is all his, it seems! Bouncer cramps him at the chest. He has no control over this shot. But it's trickled through to the third man boundary. 24 off the over!

Point, cover comes in, extra cover, mid-off in
Neesham to Brathwaite, 2 runs, pulls out to deep midwicket and comes back for the second! Grandhommehat. An. Innings. He doesn't get to do a lot very often, down at No. 8. But every time he finds himself in this situation, he shines through. A maiden ODI hundred. An unlikely win in sight. Takes his helmet off, blows a kiss. Back to it.

Neesham to Brathwaite, OUT, has he done it? No! Boult plucks it at long-on! Two drops for Boult since the last game, but he's held on when it's mattered! They're checking for no-ball...it's well behind the line. This is heartbreak for Brathwaite. So close. Short ball at middle, he pulled it, but slightly from under again. Ended up slicing it, with no room. It was to Boult's right. He leaped, he held on, he balanced on his right foot. That is solid work under pressure. Both batsmen on their knees, and then Brathwaite gets up with a smile. He did his all, and then some. But it was always unlikely. And you feel like he knows that. Smiles from his opponents as they offer their commiserations. It's all shakes. It could have so easily been the other way round...
