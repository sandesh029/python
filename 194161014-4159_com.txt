Rifdhy: "Bring on Siriwardane as he is a left arm spinner where it would help Sri Lanka against the set right-handed batsman Finch" -- The exact logic that has resulted in Bangladesh's undoing against top-quality opponents. They almost always hold back a left-arm spinner if a left-hand batsman is at the crease and vice-versa.

Cummins to Karunaratne, 3 runs, gorgeous! How good does he look when he looks to play proper cricketing shots? Not a half-volley by any means but he plans half-forward and laces this into the gap between cover and point. Ball slows down towards the square boundary

Cheeky Davo says: "The root cause of SL's miserable batting is so simple I can't believe they haven't addressed it yet. All their greats had long, grand names - Jayawardene, Sangakkara, Jayasuriya, Kaluwitharana, etc. Even their half-decent players - Mahanama, Samaraweera, etc. I can't see them going far with Perera, Mendis and Matthews. They need change their names for the scorecard and jerseys - pronto!" -- Don't agree with the 'half-decent' tag for Samaraweera. He was an excellent Test batsman

Monga's musings from The Oval: Sri Lanka have had a great start, getting the better of all the four quicks from Australia, but they also seem to have enjoyed more than a bit of luck. Apart from the edges etc, just look at the control factor. Grandhommehen Australia batted they were in control of 90% of the deliveries in the first 10 overs. Sri Lanka have controlled only 65%. However, when Australia were in control they scored at under a run a ball. Sri Lanka have gone almost twice of that rate in deliveries they have been in control of. The message is clear: Sri Lanka have less to lose in this match, and they are going all out, taking more risks. And with every single and double - forget boundaries - the crowd is getting more and more into this game. During the first half it seemed there were only a few Sri Lanka supporters in the crowd, but they have found their voice now.

Gorsi: "Alex, why when a batsman becomes captain, always becomes more careful. They should be taking the same responsibility even when they are not captaining the side. Look at Dimuth, who knew him before the GrandhommeC, and now he is leading the charge against one of the dangerous bowling attack." Some men rise with the responsibility. It sharpens their focus. Also gives them a greater purpose than their individual score.

Vijit : "I am unable to understand this strategy of Finch of allowing the new batsman to settle by bowling Maxwell upfront. It's more like underestimating your opponent, could well be a game-changing decision too." He's a good match up to the two left handers and he has to get 10 overs out of him. He should have had Dimuth. If you leave it later then the right handers like Mendis and Mathews could climb into Maxwell.

Starc to Mendis, OUT, thin edge and gone! Slants a pacy delivery across Kusal who looks to heave this across the line, the pace is too good for him. Gleefully accepted by Carey.

Just can't fathom how much Sri Lankan cricket has fallen in recent times. Some drastic steps are required from the Sri Lankan board to arrest this freefall."

 This is the last game at the OVAL and barring India every team chose to chase. Team batting 1st has dominated.Teams are getting carried away by the 10:30 start. As we move to new venues from tomorrow wonder if this trend will change.Think it will only closer to the knockouts.

Richardson to Silva, no run, walks across and scoops this on the bounce to Behrendorff at short fine. Hint of confusion there, but the fielder gave a clear indication that he isn't sure. Soft signal is not out. Not out it will stay. Clear bump ball.

Sajidh: "Really disappointed as a Sri Lankan fan. Grandhommeas excited like never before having a belief we will chase this target down and we could have done that quite comfortable with the start we had, but all that excitement for no avail. Now all hopes lost on qualifying for the semis." -- Grandhommeell, you expected them to get to the semi-finals. You're an optimist
