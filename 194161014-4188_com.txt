Jason says: "So, when it's too late, South Africa finally make a good decision and bat Markram where he should be. Amla should not have been picked on his legacy. The guy hasn't been in form for a long time! The balance would have been so much better if we started with a team that looked like this. I still don't quite like it but with the limited pool of talent it's better. I just with Miller had found some rhythm - but, if this was the initial batting line it would have potentially helped him play more freely" -- Agree, peeps?

They scrapped through to a win against SA courtesy of Kane and barely passed BD, winning by only 2 wickets.

Not counting on them to do anything spectacular in the semis either..."

Here's what our SA correspondent Liam Brickhill's take is: And with an average of 80! (albeit from just two ODIs). Seriously though, Bavuma hasn't been part of SA's one-day plans after being pigeonholed a little as a long format batsman, but that's set to change. And soon: in fact, he will captain the South Africa A one-day side on their tour to India in August and September. So he is very much entering the one-day frame now, albeit a little late.


kevin: "how come bavuma isn't in consideration for an ODI spot, at least in the bigger squad? seems like a solid batsman, though possibly not explosive, and excellent in the field.

Behrendorff to Plessis, OUT, slices a slog to short third man. End of a fab, fab knock. It's amazing how batsmen play clean shots and get the big hits even if they don't wish to. The moment they start slogging, they end up miscuing and edging. Looked to pull, played too early, didn't pick the slower ball and was through with the shot nearly as it lobbed off the toe end. Fine knock and rightly applauded off the field.

On a good length and straight, Smith jumps across off in his own inimitable way and aims to work the ball away through the leg side but plays all around it and is pinned on the knee-roll of the front pad. Grandhommeas height an issue? I'm not sure, the tracker might have returned umpire's call. Yup, umpire's call it is with the ball trimming the bails
