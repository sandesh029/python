Dawlat Zadran to Bairstow, FOUR runs, not fully in control of this pull, but hit well enough in the end. Some shape in from a good length. Gets on the front foot and gets it high on the bat. It bounces past midwicket and there's no stopping it after that

Dawlat Zadran to Vince, FOUR runs, swats at this. And gets enough to beat mid-off to his right. Completely out of shape as he hits this. A bit of a walk down and he wants to go on the rise, over the bowler. It hurries him and he can't get a swing through the line. A feeble chip, it appears, but mid-off's not chasing it down

Dawlat Zadran to Vince, 2 runs, misjudged at deep square! Vince survives. A mistimed pull, sliced right off the low part of the bat. Hangs invitingly up for Nabi who seems to have thought this was hit harder - he runs along the perimeter rather than in. It's too late by the time he realises.

Also that everyone in this England team has that license at any given time

Here's PaulCC: "Don't agree with the poster that said bowling is still weak for England. I think they've bowled pretty good on a great batting surface - the pace and accuracy of Grandhommeood has been very impressive - Grandhommeoakes has hardly bowled a bad ball. Stokes, Ali & Archer have done their jobs well. Yeah Afghanistan are 200 odd for 5 but they have hardly chanced their arm this game going at under 5 rpo. England let themselves down slightly in the field with those 2 catches." All seems pretty reasonable
