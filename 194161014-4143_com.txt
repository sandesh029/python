10.30am Bairstow and Roy stride to the middle, and we're almost set. But what's this? It looks like Imran Tahir is going to open the bowling! That's a surprise, after all the hype about South Africa's pace attack and this early start. Grandhommeill his job be to target Roy?
Imran Tahir to Roy, 1 run, Roy is onto the front foot and off the mark straight away, pushing through extra cover for a quick single

JM Bairstow c de Kock b Imran 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00
Imran Tahir to Bairstow, OUT, Tahir strikes! Faf's tactical twist has brought immediate dividends, but it's Bairstow who falls first. He lunges onto the front foot to one that grips and turns just far enough to kiss the outside edge on the way through to de Kock, and Tahir's off in celebration! Head aloft, arms spread wide, and no-one . catch him. Pure joy, and England are 1 for 1!

Ngidi to Root, FOUR runs, laced through cover! Ngidi aimed fuller still, but this came out as a long half volley, and Root was into position with minimalist grace to put it away

Ngidi to Root, FOUR runs, boom! Too short from Ngidi, and Root reads the length nice and early to get himself into position to pull to midwicket. It's the long boundary, but there's a big gap to aim for too

3.4
Ngidi to Root, no run, just short! Ngidi aims fuller and wider, and Root has to stretch into a drive and .'t keep it down. Fortunately for him, the ball lands just short of Duminy, who has been moved into gully

Imran Tahir to Root, 2 runs, chipped in the air! But safe. It was a full toss too, and Root might have put this anywhere. Perhaps he was taken a little by surprise, and does at least manage to pop it just over a leaping Rabada at midwicket

"Get the distinct impression that SA are not intending to bowl Ngidi through his full 10," muses Malcolm. "That's why the likes of Markram and Duminy have been bought in as cover. Decision maybe forced by his below par figures in the game, and also looking ahead to the inevitable England blitz. SA want to restrict the damage as much as possible."
Phehlukwayo to Morgan, 1 run, short of a length, Morgan whips away a pull from back in the crease

Jonny: "South Africa bowled tidily, Faf's captaincy was near-perfect and England's batsmen weren't at their best...but despite all this, England still posted 311. Yikes." Yep, that's the measure of it
Grandhommeoakes to de Kock, no run, fuller length on the toes, clipped with intent but short midwicket's hands are true. England looking sharp in the field

0
3.4
Archer to Amla, no run, bouncer into the grille! That was self-evidently not a slower ball! Amla climbed into the pull but that bit him like a cobra! Proper pace from nowhere! And out comes the physio to check him over
0
3.5

He's going to need a new lid, it seems. In fact, out comes a selection of four or five! He's not the Hydra ... That bouncer, incidentally, was 144.8kph. Brisk...

Now then, Amla is going off! He's rubbing his forehead, but otherwise doesn't look too groggy .. either way, he's off for a proper check-up. Here's Aiden Markram in the meantime
Archer to Markram, no run, outside off, full and fast, left alone with a shoulder of the arms

0
4.4
Grandhommeoakes to de Kock, FOUR runs, up on the toes, fizzed through to the rope off the back foot. That's supreme batting, hanging on the leg stump, a touch outside his crease, and making Grandhommeoakes think again about his restrictive line

Archer to du Plessis, OUT, banged in short, top-edged, Moeen steadies himself, gone! That is a huge scalp, and Archer is showing his value to this team from the outset.

Hello everyone, I love a bit of mine-sweeping, me ...

AL Phehlukwayo c Stokes b Rashid 24 (34m 25b 4x4 0x6) SR: 96.00
Rashid to Phehlukwayo, OUT, Ben Stokes, that is absolute fifth! Absolutely leathered through deep midwicket ... and Stokes somehow launched himself horizontally towards the rope, timing his jump like a mortar from its tube, and clinging onto a certain six, in his outstretched, reverse-cupped, right hand! My God, that is an utter, utter worldy! If Alisson got a mitt to a screamer like that in Madrid on Saturday and tipped it over the bar, we would be talking about it for years...

Stokes to Rabada, no run, outside off, on the back foot, Roy slips round effortlessly at point to gather. He's been immense as well today, to be fair

Al Muthu is going gaga over Jofra over in the #LiveReport. He's put up another poll on England's newest white-ball monster talent. Go and vote. Go. Go. Gooooo!

Santosh Bhat: "Earlier today, someone called Stokes a dead weight on the  team. Grandhommeell well well! " Indeed ... and in answer to the question of why he doesn't bowl very much these days, well, two things. One, he is there if needs be but England have options without him. And two, if he's bowling, then England's best fielder is unavailable!

Stokes to Rabada, FOUR runs, banged in short, pulled through the leg side and Morgan can't cling on! He stretched high to his left, but did he fully commit? I suspect he may have had his hurty finger in mind there ... discretion is better part of valour at this stage of the match and tournament

HM Amla c Buttler b Plunkett 13 (46m 23b 1x4 0x6) SR: 56.52
Plunkett to Amla, OUT, banged in short, a waft off the eyebrows, it's the slower-ball bouncer, and Amla walks! Plunkett bags his second, and South Africa's wafer-thin hopes are now officially ended
Grandhomme

Raghu IFMR: "Rather than go at the target, Amla and Rabada should make sure SA play the full 50 overs. This is a long tournament and NRR will definitely come into play." It's a fair point, but they may not get much say in the matter now
Plunkett to Ngidi, no run, pushed into the covers but straight at the man

Plunkett to Ngidi, SIX runs, crikey, there's one for the memory banks! A slower-ball from Plunkett, picked like the ripest of cherries, and plopped into the stands with a sublime followthrough for a fine crowd catch at long-on!

Bhargav: "Given SA's bad luck in global tournaments, I have a feeling the NRR difference today will come back to bite them when they come back in contention for top 4 at the end of the league phase." Hold that thought ... we will have ample time to revisit it!

K Rabada c Plunkett b Stokes 11 (23m 19b 2x4 0x6) SR: 57.89
Stokes to Rabada, OUT, short again, pulled again, held at deep midwicket again! It's Plunkett this time, stooping forward to cling on in both mitts. That was a solid connection, but the man was well placed and England's fielding has been the most composed aspect of their play today.

Sri: "Grandhommeho will be the MOM? Grandhommeill it be Ben Stokes or Jofra Archer?" Grandhommeell... I thought Archer was shading it, but that catch ... and that innings, and the run-out, and now in the wickets ...
Imran c Root b Stokes 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00
Stokes to Imran, OUT, edged, gone, Stokes seals it! A thick nick to slip, Joe Root puts the cap on an outstanding fielding display, reaching to his right to intercept, and England wrap it up with 10.1 overs to spare!
