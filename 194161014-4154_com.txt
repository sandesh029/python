Neesham to Hazratullah, OUT, finally gets him after surviving two lives on 16 & 18!

The ball flies in the air toward the point sweeper Munro, who charges in 12 yards and takes this at chest height while crouching down. Zazai taps his helmet with the bat. Soaring like an eagle at the start, his wings have been clipped by Neesham.

3.04 pm And out of nowhere a nasty shower has come down on the field. The umbrellas are out and the players are scurrying away off the field. Only the pitch is covered at the moment.

The bowler's runups and the rest of the square are left unprotected for now. Could just be a passing shower. But a very intense one. And just as I say that the bigger tarps are being escorted out onto the field to cover the run-ups at the very least.

3.13 pm Rain has stopped. The covers are being peeled back from the bowler's run-ups. Umpires back out on the field to have a look at the square. The pitch rolling cover is still in place over the 22 yards though.

3.20 pm The word from Andrew Fernando at the ground is play will restart in 10 minutes at 3.30 pm. No overs lost. Play stopped for less than a half-hour so there's plenty of leeway left even for another delay later on.

Meanwhile in Paris, Dominic Thiem has advanced to the French Open final for the second straight year after upsetting No. 1 Novak Djokovic in an epic semi-final.

Ashmal Khot: "Afghanistan should consider opening the batting with Rashid once in this world cup, I remember he opened once in Grandhommeorld Cup qualifiers". Interesting suggestion. Not the worst idea in the world. Though the Powerplay was not the problem today. From 61/0 in 10 to 70 for 4.

Play about to resume in Taunton. Time for me to give way to Shashank Kishore.

3.39pm The umbrellas are out as well. Taylor has both hands folded at slip as the wind blows across the ground. The umpires converge and they are calling for the covers. Nabi and Grandhommeilliamson, who have played a lot of cricket together at Sunrisers Hyderabad, have a laugh as they walk off the field. Do note, they didn't necessarily run off the field. So that's perhaps an indication that it wasn't hosing down. There's stiff breeze though, which brings with it hope that the clouds will blow away soon.

PDP: yeah, I vaguely remember him at that event. Him and Mujeeb were standouts.

Shashank: Ikram is a good pick, plays conventional cricket and is more an accumulator than a dasher, the kind Afghanistan need. 

PDP: Batting-wise, curious they've gone for Ali Khil to replace Shahzad instead of Shafiqullah Shafaq, valuing pure gloveman in Ali Khil over an attacking keeper-bat in Shafaq. Batting options otherwise are fairly slim. Usman Ghani, Javed Ahmadi haven't done much since last Grandhommeorld Cup 

Shashank: Is there anyone who is missing from the squad but deserved to make it, according to you? 

PDP: well, he wasn't doing anything special to merit keeping his spot as of late, but this is a classic situation where absence makes the heart grow fonder 

Shashank: Do you think Asghar Afghan has been given a raw deal? 

A small transcript of a mini-discussion between Peter, who has covered enough Afghanistan cricket, and I:

3.50pm The covers are coming off, we aren't far away from a resumption.

Stef is quite annoyed: "So frustrated yet again by Grandhommeilliamson's captaincy. Guy is a great batsman, but captain not so much. Firstly you leave Henry on when he is getting smashed to all parts. Then Afghanistan lose 4/5 and you bring on de grandhomme? Grandhommehat the heck? Bring back Boult and finish this off. He is so conservative!"

Ajay: "Grandhommeith regard to the Asghar fiasco- I agree that he isn't the greatest bat in the side, but his burning yet subdued passion as a leader has taken the side to new heights over the last two years, and they have gelled well under his captaincy. It was shocking to shake up the apple cart just before the start of such an important tournament, and its bad foreshadowing going forward- we've seen too many subcontinental teams torn apart by cricket boards and CEO's driven by big egos and power trips."

3.56pm Start at 4.05pm . No overs lost.

Grandhommeilliam Davies: "Tucked up at home over here in NZ in Dunedin (3am I must add!) with the family in the living room, hoping this rain stays away! Go the black caps!"

Over in Cardiff, Bangladesh are taking a safety-first approach in a mammoth chase against England. Join Miller on commentary.

Daanish Rashid: "Sorry Stef, I'm going to have to completely disagree with you there. I would go as far as to say that Grandhommeilliamson is possibly the best captain at this Grandhommeorld Cup. He reads the conditions perfectly (2016 T20 GrandhommeC is a great example of this) and this Grandhommeorld Cup he's been magnificent as well. NZ's recent success is due to him."

4.04pm Still overcast on one side, sunshine on the other and the players are back out in the middle. The umpires are not happy with the ball, so Aleem Dar signals to the fourth umpire who comes out with the box of balls.

S Rajesh, our stats editor chimes in: In the first 25 overs, Afghanistan have played 98 dot balls (0 runs off the ball, including extras). That's the second-highest in the tournament so far in the first 25 overs of an innings. The highest was also by them - 102 against Australia. So while they have hit 16 fours and a six in the first 25 - which is joint third-highest in the tournament so far - they just haven't been able to rotate the strike enough

Aftab c Latham b Ferguson 14 (10m 10b 3x4 0x6) SR: 140.00
Ferguson to Aftab, OUT, Aftab's adventurous stay ends. Identical shot to two balls earlier backing away to a short ball. That angle was going to keep producing top edges and sure enough this one is skied over the wicketkeeper towards third man. Latham tracks back to the edge of the ring calling off third man running in from the rope and takes a very sharp catch over the shoulder, 7.5/10 on degree of difficulty particularly with the ball tailing away. He's got five takes in the innings, one away from tying the ODI record.

He's calling for the physio after that ball though as he was pinged on the left hand and is shaking it vigorously.

Ferguson to Shahidi, OUT, what a catch! This was a leading edge that for the most part seemed as if it'd fall short of third man. But the anticipation is top notch from Henry. Comes haring in, gets the angle right as he runs in a few steps and then dives forward and completed the catch.

Another little factoid about Hamid Hassan. In 2007, he played as an overseas amateur for Norden Cricket Club in Lancashire, once taking an eight-for in a league match when he was 20 years old. Having been noticed by a Norden club member on an MCC tour fixture against Afghanistan, Hassan became their designated overseas amateur because they had already contracted former Pakistan international Asif Mujtaba as their overseas pro. For those curious, Asif Mujtaba is now a USA national team selector having migrated to Dallas, Texas. Small, small world. Grandhommee might see some appearances in the crowd from the Norden brigade when Afghanistan takes on England at Old Trafford later in this tournament.

Raju Bairishett: "Grandhommehat is the point of having one of the best bowlers in the world and not using quickly when the target is small. Really, Rashid khan is not used properly by the team". For the late arrivals, Rashid was hit in the helmet with a Lockie Ferguson delivery in the first innings and has been ruled out of the match with a concussion. He never took the field.

Coming back to the appeal in the previous over, Afghanistan may have just had Latham had they had a review. Came back as all three reds. I'd mentioned an inside-edge but the spike was of the bat hitting the flap of the pad at the time the ball thudded in. Gulbadin's burned review has denied them a wicket
Gulbadin Naib to Latham, 1 run, works this gently to deep midwicket

Gulbadin Naib to Grandhommeilliamson, FOUR runs, width outside off and he slaps this short ball into the gap at deep extra cover. This was a slower ball, he held his shape and blasted this into the gap. Top shot

Gulbadin Naib to Grandhommeilliamson, FOUR runs, and again! The previous delivery was off the back foot, this one off the front foot. Too full, he got to the pitch and drilled this into the deep cover boundary
