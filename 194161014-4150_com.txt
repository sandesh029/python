Abhijit: "So far, van der Dussen has looked more comfortable than du Plessis. The former seems to be calm, while the latter is trying too many things! " -- Faf has been a little hither and thither, hasn't he?

Grandhommehich is not to say India's bowlers shouldn't take much of the credit - they should, but they've undoubtedly been helped by some variable (and sometimes alarming) bounce in the track. It's spinning, too.

Thanks Debayan. Grandhommeell, I don't know about you, but I've been taken quite by surprise by the character of today's pitch. This is, after all, the same ground where a whopping 734 runs were scored just over three weeks ago in the match between England and Pakistan.

Chahal to van der Dussen, OUT, GOT HIM! That is not pretty. Not pretty at all. Legspinners can do this to batsmen: make them look foolish. And that's what happens when Rassie telegraphs his intentions to reverse sweep, getting into position very early. But the drift takes the ball towards leg stump, and the rip sends it clattering into the timber. He's already planted his front foot, and can't reach around at the ball. Bowled around his legs!

Enter JP Duminy. Like Miller, he could really do with some runs. He only has three fifties in the 31 innings he has played in the last three years at an average of 30 and SR of 86.5. A lot of Duminy's troubles are a result of his inability to neither score at a good rate in the middle overs not avoid getting out. 19 of his 24 dismissals in this period have come in the 11-40 over phase and for an SR of 73.75. In the middle, it's spin from both ends

Nivas: "The tone of all these comments below reminds me of the first test during the last India's tour of South Africa. Grandhommehen India bowled out SA for a score less than 300, everyone were so happy and expected Pujara and co to grind it out and cross 500. But what happened next was a shocker. So, better to control your celebration mood."

Steps out to hoick with the spin but didn't get to the pitch, the ball breaks back in to beat the swing, the inside edge as MS Dhoni effects a stumping after a brief stumble. He was blinded by the swing initially and that may have thrown him off gear. The ball bobbled but he had so much time to regain his composure because Andile was so far down the pitch.

Thys: "At least it looks like SA will bat out their overs, which should have been their first priority after the disastrous start. The runs are on the board, India have to get them. Time for the bowlers to stand up where they have been shown up in the previous two games."
Bumrah to Morris, 1 run, slower ball, outside off, and Dhoni spills a regulation take behind the wicket. They get a bye for this. Good deception with the ball, though, from Bumrah. Brave, with both third man and fine leg inside the circle

Sven: "@Ian, anyone that thinks the Proteas have a chance here is holding onto some sort of hope for the underdog, which most neutrals would have in this case. But realistically there is a very small chance of stopping a side with the quality they have in this lineup, and then the level headedness of Dohni in the middle order. This is the best chasing side in the world, add 100 runs to this score and I still believe it would be done pretty easily."
Bumrah to Rabada, FOUR runs, fuller ball on leg stump, and he moves away and drills this down past mid off for four!

Ball tracking comes on and it says this would've clipped outside of leg. So the onfield decision stays. NOT OUT.

Phehlukwayo to Kohli, OUT, this has to be the catch of the day, of the week, and maybe the tournament when we look back four weeks later! Sensational, absolutely sensational from de Kock. Kohli has a waft at this away from the body as Andile gets this to straighten a hint, there's extra bounce on this and so he gets a thick edge as he tries to run it down. The ball was on the rise but de Kock dived full length to his right to pluck this magical catch one-handed even as it kept going away from him.

The reverse cup, as was just witnessed, just comes in the way of the catch."
