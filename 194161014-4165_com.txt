Q de Kock b Boult 5 (8m 8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 62.50
Boult to de Kock, OUT, bowled him, stumps flying all over the place! He's been looking for that full one angling in towards leg stump all through the over, and he bowls another. De Kock leaves a bit of a hole in his attempted on-drive - the result of his front foot not really getting forward at all - and the ball simply bursts through. Judging by how the rest of the over's gone, a definite plan from Boult - something to do with de Kock's lack of feet movement early on, and maybe the angle that his bat comes down at, from around gully or thereabouts

Faf du Plessis walks in at No. 3.
Boult to du Plessis, 2 runs, gets a full one first up, outside off, and he gets a good stride out to drive with an open face to the left of extra-cover. Big mix-up between the batsmen - not sure when exactly, because the TV pictures are a complete muddle - but Faf dives and makes his ground in time to beat his throw to the keeper

Henry to Amla, 3 runs, full, angling into off stump. Amla looks for the cover drive, a hands shot with feet going nowhere.

Boult to Amla, no run, Ooh, that's some sharp inswing. A fullish length, and once again Amla's front foot goes nowhere. Tries to flick it hurriedly, following the swing, but his front pad is in the way. No appeal - the impact was outside leg stump and the ball was missing leg too

Faf du Plessis finished the 2015 Grandhommeorld Cup with an average of 36. He's bulked that up to 46 now thanks to a really good last four years. In that time, he's even made public a wish to move from a good player to a great player and that's the focus whenever he trains.

Boult to Amla, FOUR runs, shot! Given that Amla doesn't really get on the front foot to most deliveries, bowlers can occasionally try and go fuller to try and draw him forward. This one's got a bit of width on it, though, and not much swing back in, and Amla waves his wand of a bat at it - it's a diagonal bat, but does it matter when he connects so cleanly? - and sends it racing away through cover point

He runs across to his left from deep square leg, the ball comes at him at a rather awkward height, but Boult makes life difficult for him by leaping. Both his feet are in the air as he goes for the catch with both hands. The ball ultimately pops out of his hands.

Boult to Miller, no run, misses out. On the shorter side of a length, but plenty of width, and he slaps it straight to extra-cover. There's an appeal for a run-out at the non-striker's end...

The ball is rising steeply, and he's moving away from it's line, so he can't quite control the uppercut, ends up offering a catch to third man moving to his left. Good innings, though.

Yoga: "I always felt that Miller is like Raina for India, comes to bat often after 30th over sometimes after 40, has to keep the run rate right from the 1st ball, when trying to accelerate gets out mostly in 30s and some 50s and rarely gets a big one. And not the least a left handed and similar batting position." -- Pretty good comparison. Both have their technical limitations, but it's a difficult job and they've often done a very good job of it.
Van der Dussen is ready to face again.

Henry to van der Dussen, SIX runs, length ball on off stump, and Rassie puts it away. Clears his front leg and hoicks it over the square leg boundary. Dragged it much squarer than intended, off the inner half, but the square boundary on that side is pretty short

Henry to van der Dussen, 1 run, slower short ball, angling into the body, and that's dropped on the fine leg boundary.

48.1
Third man, fine leg, deep point, deep square leg, and long-on are the boundary fielders.

Ferguson to van der Dussen, SIX runs, wham, that sounded so good off the bat. Looks to make room again, and Ferguson goes short. But it sits up at chest height, within the batsman's hitting arc, and he absolutely hammers it over long-on
6
48.5
Ferguson to van der Dussen, FOUR runs, great finish from van der Dussen. Looks to make room again, and this time Ferguson tries to go full. Doesn't get it full enough, and he can get underneath it and drive it hard, back over the bowler's head. Mid-off is up, and long-on is too wide, so it runs away for four to edge South Africa past 240

JDS Neesham c Amla b Morris 23 (60m 34b 3x4 0x6) SR: 67.64
Morris to Neesham, OUT, gone! Steered straight to the man at wide slip! Morris' over-the-wicket angle to the left-handers has picked up another wicket. Cross-seam, just short of a length, angling away from off stump, and Neesham leans back and steers it, probably looking for third man, but the ball bounces a little more than he'd like and he ends up hitting it straight into Amla's lap. Takes it well, falling to his left

Right then, it's down to NZ needing 58 off 54 balls with five wickets in the shed. Fasten your seat belts for this could be another blockbuster between these two sides
Rabada to Grandhommeilliamson, 1 leg bye, Oh my, a comedy of errors at Edgbaston. Awful mix-up between the wickets. Miller fluffs a run-out chance and reprieves Grandhommeilliamson. This was another well-directed short ball at the body, comes off pretty slow off the surface. Grandhommeilliamson is early into the pull and wears it on his body. De Grandhomme wants a single, Grandhommeilliamson doesn't. Rabada, the bowler himself, swoops down on the ball. The throw is to Miller at the non-striker's end. He is in a rush. He is under pressure. He dislodges the bails without collecting the ball. Grandhommehat a big miss for SA. Is that the game?
