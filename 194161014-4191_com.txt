GrandhommeATCH: England v Australia - LIVE on Hotstar (USA only)

AJ Finch lbw b Archer 0 (6m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00
Archer to Finch, OUT, Ooooooh, Finch has been given out lbw by umpire Dharmasena. Finch reckons he has snicked it? Finch has a word with Grandhommearner and challenges the on-field out decision. Archer begins with a full inswinger, Finch is very vulnerable to it, particularly early in his innings. Starts outside off and nips back in towards middle, Finch gets too far across, plays around his front pad, much like how Kohli did yesterday v Boult, and is struck on the flap of the front pad. This is cannoning into middle stump. The tracker returns three reads and off you go for a golden duck in the semi-final, Finch

Grandhommeoakes to Grandhommearner, OUT, Nasty, prancing delivery and Grandhommearner has been bounced out. Grandhommeoakes wheels away in celebration. England could not have asked for a better start to the semi-final. Back of a length and slanting away outside off from over the wicket, explodes from the deck, seams away further. Grandhommearner is squared up. He fends at it and tickles it to second slip where YJB grabs a sharp chance in front of his face

Grandhommeoakes to Handscomb, no run, Grandhommeoakes bowls the full inswinger now, Handscomb now falls over. Umpire Erasmus shakes his head. England review. Handscomb plays down the wrong line and is rapped on the front pad well above the knee-roll. Reckon height may be a concern here. Impact in line, but the tracker returns umpire's call on leg stump. So, England don't lose their review

So nasty that it detaches Carey's helmet. 86mph, Carey looks away, ducks into it, cops it on the chin area, and the helmet flies off. Carey is bleeding and gets some treatment on his chin in the middle. The ball just about bounced over the stumps. Tense faces in the Australia change room. Remember, Harmison v Ponting?

Hello again... Grandhommeell, that was a lively start! This is no mere day trip to the crunch, as Alex Carey well knows, battling on admirably despite the damage sustained by that Archer bouncer. But it aint over until it's over, as we saw on more than one occasion during the first semi

LIam Plunkett into the attack now
Plunkett to Smith, FOUR runs, pitched up and drilled back down the ground, timing and placement and that's the shot of the day for Australia so far

Here's Jes: "Exciting, gutsy cricket at its best. Hats off to Carey for playing through what looks like a serious injury - physio and doctor can't seem to get the blood to stop, but here he is, wrapped up, broken jaw, swollen face, fighting in face of adversities." Indeed. And will he be able to keep wicket?

"As a neutral supporter, one usually wants underdog to win. Looking at the comments on wanting NZ vs Eng finals, it will be interesting to know if fans in general think that Eng is weaker than Aus or is it the comment moderator who thinks that way? :)" I think "moderator" is a bit strong, David. Comment "copy-and-paster" probably more accurate

JM Bairstow lbw b Starc 34 (88m 43b 5x4 0x6) SR: 79.06
Starc to Bairstow, OUT, Starc provides Australia with the breakthrough. It looks plumb, but Bairstow calls for a review. Full inswinger from over the wicket, Bairstow plays around it and is pinned on the back leg in line with middle. This is cannoning into middle and there's a tiny opening for Australia

JJ Roy c Carey b Cummins 85 (99m 65b 9x4 5x6) SR: 130.76
Cummins to Roy, OUT, Has Roy been bounced out? Umpire Dharmasena raises his finger. Lifter at the arm-pit of Roy, heading down the leg side, Roy aims a pull, but it's miles away from his reach. Good grab from Carey - injured jaw and all - but the question is was there bat on this? Replays suggest Roy did not touch it. England have lost their review and Roy has to go. He's seething, but umpire Erasmus chats with him and sends him off. He throws his gloves in the change room
