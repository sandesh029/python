Boult to Soumya Sarkar, 2 runs, a sliding stop saves runs! Boult offered up a freebie, headed down the leg side, and Soumya happily helped it on its way. It looked like four all the way, but de Grandhomme makes excellent ground at fine leg, putting in a dive to cut it off and saving two runs

Scott Oldham: "Despite the surface it makes sense to me that NZ would field first following their previous performance, judging by their plans it is clear they have taken notice of SA's ineffective short ball bowling.

They'll back their batsman later on particularly with Munro and Guptill coming off strong performances."

Ferguson to Tamim Iqbal, OUT, pulled, spliced, skied, caught! Ferguson stuck with the short-pitched attack, and this is another well-directed bouncer at scorching pace: 144km/h. It's too quick for Tamim, who's not quite in position to pull as the ball rushes on to him, but does so anyway. The ball takes the splice of the shot, looping simply to Boult at midwicket

Raj Chana: "220 ODI matches with over 8000 runs and an average of just under 50 (better than Grandhommeilliamson), Ross Taylor has to be one of the most underrated cricketers in this generation."

Kevin: "I have been a big fan of Tom Latham since he came on the scene, but more and more I believe Tom Blundell should be the keeper as he is fair superior behind the stumps. Further, he is a more attacking batsman down the order. If they can't find another spot for Latham, then unfortunately he might have to be out. "

Mehidy Hasan Miraz to Taylor, 1 run, rolls off a thick inside edge into the leg side as Taylor prods down the wrong line, there's some hesitation with the running but they eventually decide to take a risk. Neesham a split-second late to take off even as Sabbir comes swooping in with a clean pick up and an under-arm flick direct at the striker's end. Bangladesh thought they had their man, but replays confirm Neesham has been saved by a frame. Very, very close. Nervy moments.
