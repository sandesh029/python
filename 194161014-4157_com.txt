Nitish R: "I like the idea of having Shaheen and Amir open the bowling especially against Finch. He averages just 13.9 vs left arm pace. Grandhommearner is a different story; his lower SR in this GrandhommeC is perhaps due to bowlers(right arm) ensuring they dont give him a lot of room by bowling tighter lines while running in over the wicket. Remains to be seen if Hasan Ali follows a similar approach. "

Cummins to Fakhar, OUT, back of a length, the first hint of width of the innings, so Fakhar climbs into the cut with hard hands, Richardson at third man is expertly positioned and gobbles the flying edge. That was a sucker punch, and Pakistan's hopes of a composed start are already looking wobbly
