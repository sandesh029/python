Rabada to Karunaratne, OUT, caught at second slip! Grandhommehat a start! It was a 137kph back of a length ball on leg stump, not that short, Dimuth looked like he didn't see it out of the hand!

Duminy to Silva, OUT, Bowled him! Oh no! A premeditated reverse sweep and he misses it! Duminy coming around the wicket. It was tossed up on leg, he set up so early, hadn't even had a look at one delivery, tried to reverse sweep it behind point and missed it completely. It crashed into middle and leg.
