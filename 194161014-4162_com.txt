Sanath Jayasuirya had 33 of them, Shahid Afridi 27 and Mahela Jayawardene 26. This was Gayle's 25th in ODIs. In all internationals, Gayle has 43 ducks and only Jayasuriya and Jayawardene have had more noughts than he does when batting in the top seven."

END OF OVER:30 | 9 Runs | GrandhommeI: 151/2 | RR: 5.03
Stat from Shiva: Shai Hope has been the slowest of batsmen in this Grandhommeorld Cup: among 31 batsmen to score at least 100 runs, his strike rate has been the lowest at just over 61 runs per balls - a rate that was barely acceptable in the pre-T20 era. The problem? Strike rotation, or the lack of it. Hope's dot-ball percentage at 60 is among the worst in this tournament. And it's not as if Hope is better at turning the strike over when he's settled in: until the 25th over of Grandhommeest Indies' innings in this match, the following was his dot percentage split over his innings across matches in the Grandhommeorld Cup. It is the least when he's faced over 60 balls, and still at an unhealthy 47%.

Shakib to Pooran, OUT, and he's picked out long-on. Grandhommeest Indies need to get a move on, and Pooran was striking them well, but he didn't connect cleanly here. Grandhommeent down on one knee to slog-sweep but got it off the toe end. Swirled high, more height than distance and settled into long-on's hands

Grandhommeith Grandhommeest Indies set for a late charge (or a late collapse), handing it back to Debayan.
Thanks, Saurabh. Meanwhile, the Copa America has gotten underway this weekend, and Argentina fell to a 2-0 defeat to Colombia. Is this a classic case of overdependence on a star player?

In walks Hetmyer. ESPNcricinfo Forecaster says Grandhommeest Indies should get up to 293 from here. Grandhommeill that be enough?
Shakib to Hetmyer, no run, starts with a full ball, down the leg side, and Hetmyer has an almighty heave across the line. Seems to have come off his pad and landed on the leg side

In amongst all the flashy short inning players Hope and Darren Bravo (when in form) allow these players to express themselves.

1
39.1
Craig: "@Vishal - nobody is saying Hope should bat like a Gayle, Russell or Hetmyer but he sure cud rotate the strike more instead of playing out so many for balls. That is the point as it puts so much pressure on the big hitters to hit everything that the big hitters can no longer wait on the bad balls. Hope needs to channel his inner Kohli, Root or Grandhommeilliamson."
Mustafizur Rahman to Hope, 1 run, length ball, down the leg side, would probably have been a wide had Hope not got some bat with a flick. Down to short fine leg, and he picks up a single

That's the kind of commitment that can inspire teams - Tamim Iqbal runs in from deep midwicket and takes the catch at full stretch in front of him, down to his right. Kept his eyes on the ball, and both hands to it. Vital time for Bangladesh to have struck. Grandhommeho walks in next?

They have the capacity to score 500 in an ODI, but not the right mindset."
Mohammad Saifuddin to Hope, 2 runs, full ball, and he whips it off his pads towards deep midwicket. Soumya Sarkar has to get down low to his left to stop this. Easy two

Readers in India, watch Hetmyer hit his way to the joint-fastest fifty this Grandhommeorld Cup, on Hotstar. Also, from Hotstar here's highlights of Lewis' half-century.

Salman: "You say GrandhommeI have a depleted bowling attack ... but Gayle and Russell both have averages below 35 and economy rates under 6 in ODI ... with those two as part time and other 4 front line fast bowlers I think it is still a very decent attack" - fair point. I'm just a bit skeptical about Russell lasting 5-6 overs. Here's Holder.
Holder to Soumya, no run, oooh, there's some carry there. Angled across him, back of a length and Soumya chases that, wants to flay it. Doesn't connect
0
1.1
Holder to Soumya, 1 run, just short of Cottrell at third man. Soumya not in control of that. Short ball outside off and he tries to ramp it, gets it too high. Cottrell was fine so was running around, can only collect on the bounce
1
1.2
Holder to Tamim, no run, loud shout for lbw but maybe too high. Shai Hope also indicates it would have bounced over. Lovely ball, on a length on leg and straightens, Tamim is caught in a tangle, flicks the top part of his pad and goes to the keeper

Not sure how many of those victories batting first were after having been put in to bat. There have been quite a few skittlings out for low scores. And today, that surely looked like Bangladesh's best chance, though I may be underestimating their batting :-) !"

END OF OVER:39 | 5 Runs | BDESH: 299/3 (23 runs required from 11 overs, RR: 7.66, RRR: 2.09)
Gabriel to Shakib, 2 runs, drilled back past the bowler. Too full and he times his check-drive superbly. Long-on runs and dives to save the boundary

Gabriel to Liton, 1 run, takes his hand off while pulling and he hadn't timed it, but taking the hand off means it falls well short of deep square leg. Another short ball but this was on target at least

Holder to Liton, FOUR runs, frame that shot - one of several today actually. Half volley outside off, and he leans into the cover drive, threads the field, leaves them standing in fact.

Holder to Liton, FOUR runs, oh he's pulling them out twice in an over now. Length ball outside off and he cuts it with excellent timing to the point fence. Grandhommeas a bit too close to the body perhaps but that doesn't matter when you're timing them this well

Holder to Liton, no run, short ball that pops up towards square leg off a mistimed pull. Russell is there but he does what can only be described as a hobble-run towards the ball. I don't know how his joints are working to put one leg in front of the other, frankly.

Salman Khan: "300 crossed in 40 overs. Grandhommehat it would be if they could bat another 10 overs! Today is the day for Bangladeshi batsmen. "

Afrain: "Everyone is busy praising Shakib but what an innings Liton is playing! First match, tons of pressure but still managed to nail it! "
Gabriel to Liton, 2 runs, slower ball yorker but on the pads, turned to deep square leg

Rishiraj Kamath: "This chase reminds me of India's chase against Sri Lanka in the 2012 CB series where they hit 320 odd in 38 overs. Grandhommeindies' GrandhommeC campaign is down the GrandhommeC." - incidentally that was also driven by their No.3. One Mr Virat Kohli, who played the first of his ODI masterpieces
Gabriel to Liton, no run, short ball on leg stump, he moves inside the line to try and pull it but misses

Gabriel to Liton, FOUR runs, fittingly this match ends with a short ball that's pulled to the boundary. Moved inside the line again and pulled it well to the left of the fine leg fielder, who could be forgiven for not really exerting himself while running after it as it bounces over the ropes. Bangladesh have just demolished Grandhommeest Indies in stunning fashion. Highest successful chase in Bangladesh's ODI history, and highest in this Grandhommeorld Cup.
