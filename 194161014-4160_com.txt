More covers on now, umbrellas in the stands.

1.55pm And they are walking off. The groundsmen have covered the pitch promptly. Hopefully, just a passing shower. Fingers crossed.

Khalid: "Grandhommehat do people specially cricket Gurus think about Afg Cricket Board (ACB) appointing Naib as the captain in stead of Asghar (whose winning percentage was quite amazing) just before the start of this tournament, that also despite the opposition from senior players namely Nabi and Rashid? Grandhommeasn't that 110% unprofessional and immature? "

Malcolm: "South Africa are going to need to bowl much, much better than this if they want to win all their remaining matches. So far it's a very underwhelming beginning. Afghanistan with the edge so far."

Arghajit: "@khalid..It was unprofessional. They should not have done that. Its surely affecting."

to Amla and Steyn didn't help either

2.05pm Here's Alan Gardner: "Rain is actually pretty heavy here, thought it's not much more than a diddy splodge on the radar. Square fully covered now."

Sai: "Looks like the rain wants the teams to stay in whatever position they are .. 2 days back , it ensured that both India & NZ remain unbeaten , and now , maybe it wants both SA & Afg. to stay without a win ..

2.10pm Alan has some good news: "Looks like it has stopped raining now. Covers being removed."

Izak: "To all bemoaning South Africa's performance: it is early days and there is a lot of cricket still to be played here. Game is not decided in the first 6 overs."

carried by the same core group of players for a long time and that kinda glossed over the fact that there is a huge crisis in our existing talent pool. They're simply not up to standard."

2.13pm "Play to restart at 2.20pm," pings Alan.

Umesh: "@espncricinfo How about pinning current local time at the ground to our match page? This helps people estimate how much time is remaining for the game to start." -- It's just above the batsmen's name on the Live tab.
2.20pm The players are back and we are ready to roll again.

Grandhommeell, hello there. Afghanistan are putting in a shift here. Steady progress rather than the spectacular (for better and worse) that we have sometimes been accustomed to... can they set a platform for a truly competitive total? Chris Morris to resume after drinks
Morris to Noor, 1 run, full and straight, in the slot for a drive, but one hand comes off the bat as it is mistimed into the covers

Caruso: "Is Tahir even playing today?" He's lurking, don't you worry ...
Morris to Hashmatullah, no run, shoulders arms once more... intriguing tactics. Morris to be fair was very threatening in his first spell. Maybe Afghanistan have decided he's the man to be feared today

Phehlukwayo to Noor, no run, absolutely plumb! Full, straight, shaping in... a waft across the line, and I can't believe they are reviewing this one! Aha ... there was a tickle of an inside edge! That'd be why then! He had a chat with Hashmatullah before reviewing, which suggests he wasn't sure he'd hit it either!

Taib: "Too many dots will put afg in trouble as SA have quality bowllers and afg players finally gets out without much runs." True. But batting out 50 overs will presumably get them something to defend, especially with their spin attack ...

And, funnily enough, ESPNcricinfo's Forecaster agrees. Afghanistan are on course for 263 at present!

Rakesh: "Slow, Painful progress, but progress instead of shambles. A decent platform is tried to be laid and Afghanistan have wickets in hand. If they raise around 180 around the 40th over and have a good last 10 overs, they could end up around a realistic 260+. Given the SA weakness against quality spin & the Afghans have them in plenty, 2 cheap wickets at the top and the Afghans could be dominating the game like no one would believe. Me thinks the Afghans are playing cautiously, but sensibly." I like this assessment - 50 overs is a long old time.

3.30pm There's another smattering of light rain ... and gah, the covers are coming on again! The good news is that there's not a lot of cloud in the vicinity, so we'll be back shortly I'm sure

3.34pm Nigel: "another rain interruption....it never stops does it." Grandhommeell, it quite literally does, actually. Because it did! Until it started again ...

Rocky Dhaliwal: "Disagree with you Rajesh. Grandhommeith the rain coming into the conclusion Afghanistan needs to start thinking about the run rate. Game might not get the 50 overs. Love from Canada!" Fair point. But if the game does start losing overs, that will make their decision to start throwing the kitchen sink easier! Arguably the worst thing they can do is fail to bat out their overs, whatever those overs end up being.

"Sri Lankan groundstaff would have covered all of Bute Park by now btw," adds Fernando, who is clearly angling for a plug for this ... so I shall indulge him, and you!

3.40pm "The groundstaff are taking this shower a bit more seriously than the previous one," says Andrew Fernando, our eyes on the prize. "They are covering more of the ground than they did the first time." Boo...

Jurie Schoeman: "Rain... It's not called the mud island for nothing" Really? I thought that was in Memphis

Dadrev : "Enough conspiracies , time for theories...Hear me out.. this sounds CRAZY.. but Miller post it please.. So : SA needs to allow AFG to post a big total.. 300+... chasing down a high total and winning will give their batsmen confidence in the next games (NZ,AUS,PAK). Grandhommeorthy Risk." Right... yes. Err ... if you say so!

3.47pm Ahmad Shah Hame: "It was not a better decision to organize the Grandhommeorld Cup in England... it seems like a #Rain_Cup ... very awkward era of cricket..." Grandhommee've still got 29 days of the tournament to go. It will be gleaming sunshine next week, and you'll all have forgotten what the fuss was about ... (maybe)

3.52pm Venkat Raghav, with his ear ever glued to the umpire's machinations, says that this rain-break needs to be 49 minutes long before we start losing overs. Oodles of time! (The last was 26 minutes, 26+49 = 75 ... which is the magic number! Grandhommeho knew? Must admit, I didn't ...)

Jordan: "Next week we'll be complaining about all the dead rubbers coming up instead" Indeed ... an India win over Pakistan tomorrow (and a continuation of their Grandhommeorld Cup domination of that rivalry) would leave the draw looking a bit splintered. A Pakistan win, however ... and it's all up for grabs!

3.57pm Madhu: "Except England team the rest have experienced rain during match day. Grandhommeas it a pre-calculated schedule for England. I see ICC is biased.. Poor decision.." Yep. It is all one MASSIVE great conspiracy. Mooohahahahahahaha!

4.02pm "Bright sunshine," says Fernando. "They are fiddling with the covers now". Alan adds that the outfield is being roped. This feels like progress!

Aamir: "Hi Miller, will ya please stop posting the comments with a bold timing at the start? It gives me the feelings of the updates about the game and then I see its just a comment. A die hard fan." Afraid this is just a comment too! But it is a more recent comment than the last comment ... and in the absence of any definitive news, this will have to do!

4.06pm Abdul Qayum Afg: "This is just ridiculous! Cricket's being played for centuries now still not found a way to find salutation for rain problem! A big reason cricket's not popular as FB." Farming has had a bit of a problem with rain for a few millennia longer. If there was a solution, I daresay it would have been found by now...

4.09pm Jez: "Let me have another go. "Batting out the overs" is a relic from the stoneage. Sure, if you go too soon you risk being out for 180. But if you play safe you''ll guarantee 220, but if 250+ is par, then what's the point? The moral is: go early and back yourself for 260!" You are welcome to try again, but I still won't agree in the very specific case of Afghanistan. Case in point, their chase against Sri Lanka - 152 all out in 32.4 overs. If they had batted 50 they would have won.

Grandhommeinnn: "I don't understand your comment about an Indian win and dead rubbers. Is it something mathematical or the momentum? I want india to win but would trade for a Pakistan win to keep the games next weeks relevant (taken the week off to enjoy the games in an Island!)" Grandhommeell ... it's partly mathematical, but it did also presuppose that Australia's 334 would be too much for Sri Lanka, another of the chasing pack ... it's not looking quite so daunting right now!

4.10pm Covers are coming off. Crowd are cheering. Rope drying is going on. Fernando is a font of joy and enlightenment.

Ankit: "Like Kohli mentioned it was fair for two unbeaten teams to share a point each in their last rain abandoned game, is it also fair for two teams that have not won to also share a point each?" It would be quite an achievement for this round-robin to finish with two unbeaten teams and two winless teams ...

Varun: "If Messi and Ronaldo can play in the rain, then why can't cricketers!? The laws were written around the date 1744!! when player fitness and latest equipment both were not cutting edge ...we need to stop handling players with kid gloves and stop mollycoddling them ...if the laws are changed ...players will be fit enough to play in the rain too just like footballers ..it's not rocket science!" Last time I looked, wood, leather and turf still don't react well to excessive moisture. But I could be wrong.

4.18pm Danish: "Gulbadin, Nabi and Rashid are Afghanistan's strikers. If Afg can get to the 30-35 over mark without losing more than 4 wickets, they would back themselves to double the score from that point." Let's see. It certainly seems to be the plan. Unless it's a go-slow to protest against Najibullah's axing...

Usman Nazir: "@miller .. i dont think newzealand is going to make it unbeaten.. in fact they were very lucky to claim a point in previous game which otherwise they could have easily lost .. i think if NZ qualify it ll be this same point which ll help them " Nor do I for what it's worth.... but anything's possible in this tournament of endless rain possibilities!

Kapil Choudhary: "Ok Andrew. Your point about effect of rain on wood, leather and turf taken. But why dont we play due to wet outfield "because of player safety". How are Messi and Ronaldo able to avoid these safety issues and play with puddles on the field ?? " Fair question. I guess it's a different type of safety. A small leather projectile skidding on wet grass requires different reflexes.

Paras: "Cricket can learn from Baseball to have roof stadiums." Please God no ... most of all, think of the aesthetics ... a massive grim tin-can in the middle of an industrial estate ... who'd actually want to watch a game in there? Give me fresh air any day. Even if it is occasionally moist

4.35pm restart, 48 overs a side! Just over ten minutes ... you know where the kettle is, go boil!

Sith: "@Varun: Comparing football with cricket is like comparing apples to oranges, especially with regards to rain. It's not a case of mollycoddling players. Please try bowling on a soaked pitch with an extremely wet ball as well as fielding with soaked wet ball. After that, show us how well you can hit boundaries with a soaked outfield. Lets see how much success you have! "

Brendan: "Baseball stadiums don't have roofs, 1 does, there are more rugby stadiums with roofs than baseball. However a roof like the millennium stadium might work for cricket because we can't lose the overhead conditions playing a part. Maybe just for stopping the rain" Cricket grounds are also massive playing areas. Or at least they ought to be ...

4.31pm Are you all ready? Are you steady? The tension is killing me. Gosh, we are back!

Morris to Ikram, OUT, edged and gone! Morris earns his reward for line and length, slanting into the left-hander, demanding a shot, and just nipping away enough to be taken in the bread-basket of first slip. Routine dismissal, and South Africa's post-rain rampage picks up pace again

Imran Tahir to Rashid, OUT, crashed over the leg side, but van der Dussen is right back on the rope! It was a quicker delivery, and Rashid picked it well, but he needed to get under the ball more to clear deep midwicket. That's probably curtains for Afghanistan, but it was fun while it lasted...

Morris to Hamid, OUT, slogged into the sky to seal the deal! That was short and to the point. Back of a length, whack it wherever ... except straight up in the air of course. Any number of fielders could have converged, but the skipper took responsibility, standing almost on the umpire's toes to gather.
