Round the wicket now.

Aniket: "Bumrah is on a hat trick!" -- Can't spread a hat-trick across two matches. Across two innings of a Test match, yes. Anyway, here he is, over the wicket to Dimuth with two slips in place.

Kumar to Kperera, no run, length ball straightening along an off-stumpish line, defended to short extra
0
2.1
Kumar to Kperera, 3 runs, back of a length, angling into leg stump. The ball stops on him as he tries the short-arm jab, and the ball hits the toe end of the bat and squeezes away past midwicket diving to his left. He was aiming to hit through backward square leg
3
2.2
Back over the wicket to Dimuth, two slips in place.
Kumar to Karunaratne, FOUR runs, Two slips means a big gap between backward point and extra-cover, and Karunaratne slaps this ball into that very gap. Bad ball, short and wide with no swing

Kumar to Karunaratne, FOUR runs, not the greatest of starts from Bhuvneshwar, strays onto the legs this time, and Dimuth works it off his hip through the vacant square leg region

Bumrah to Karunaratne, OUT, gone, is it? Dhoni's convinced, and Karunaratne begins walking. Grandhommeidth on this occasion, but it isn't short enough to cut, and he plays it with an angled bat rather than a horizontal bat, and only manages a top edge
Grandhomme

Ritangshu : "@Sri, Yes this is a batting heavy XI, but don't forget we only have five bowlers once again, which means Kohli will be in trouble if any of them have an off day. Don't forget India were in a spot of bother in the last game with Shami being targeted by Bangladesh. I would swap DK (if he doesn't perform well today) with Chahal in the next game. 3 pace + 3 spin options look perfect." -- I'd swap DK for Jadhav.

Bhuvneshwar goes back round the wicket to Kusal.
Kumar to Kperera, 2 runs, oh my, miscommunication! That wasn't full enough for the big hit down the ground, and he ends up too far underneath the ball rather than behind it. Scoops it high in the air, somewhere between mid-on and mid-off, more towards the latter. Kuldeep, going to his right, drops the catch, and nearly collides with Pandya coming in the other direction

4.3
Kumar to Kperera, FOUR runs, length ball, too much width, and he just stands there and crashes it between backward point and cover point

4.5
Back over the wicket now.
Kumar to Kperera, FOUR runs, length ball, strays too straight, and Kusal nudges it off his legs nice and fine, to the left of Bumrah at fine leg, and it races away quickly, too quick for Bumrah to attempt the dive despite getting fairly close to the ball

Bumrah to Fernando, no run, length ball straightens towards off stump. Not fully behind it in defence, but plays it well enough to extra-cover
0
5.3
Bumrah to Fernando, no run, big appeal, given! That big Bumrah angle, and Avishka has tried to drive down the ground without getting a stride forward. He's reviewed it, and the thing to look out for, I think, is whether it might have missed off stump. The ball went past the inside edge and hit the back thigh pad, so height may also be an issue. It's going over the top of leg stump, ball-tracking says. No footwork from Avishka, just looked to stand there and punch through the line, down the ground
0
5.4
Bumrah to Fernando, FOUR runs, full on off stump, driven firmly down the ground, and it runs away for four despite Bumrah getting the fingertips of his right hand to it in his follow-through. First runs off Bumrah

Bumrah to Fernando, 1 wide, bouncer close to off stump. Thinks of pulling but realises it's too high for that, and leaves it alone in the end

Bumrah to Fernando, no run, length ball straightening towards off stump, defended towards short extra-cover. Once again he didn't really get behind the line in defence - his back foot stayed on leg stump, which will interest India's bowlers

Kumar to Kperera, 1 run, a bit of swing into Kusal, but into his pads, tickled to the right of Bumrah at short fine leg. He moves quickly and fires a throw at the keeper's end, but misses. Avishka would have been home even if it had hit

Kumar to Fernando, no run, fullish length ball on middle stump, defended to mid-on

6.5
Kumar to Fernando, 2 runs, full outside off, and Avishka goes for the big hit over mid-on. A good idea with the field restrictions, but he doesn't really middle it. Hangs in the air for quite a while, and it comfortably clears the fielder running back, but it plops down in the outfield and just stops there

Kperera c Dhoni b Bumrah 18 (36m 14b 3x4 0x6) SR: 128.57
Bumrah to Kperera, OUT, is that an edge? There was a sound, and both Sri Lankan openers have walked. Bumrah's been getting the ball to straighten against his angle all through this spell, and it happens again. Slants across the left-hander, straightens back just a touch, and Kusal, looking to punch to mid-on, gets an inside edge on it that Dhoni does well to catch, falling low to his right. On TV, Kumar Sangakkara notes that Kusal's bat was coming down from gully, and slicing across the line as a result

Kumar to Mendis, no run, ooh, that's a beaut. Excellent length, though the line is still a little wide of off stump. Kusal took a step out of his crease initially, and across his stumps to get close to the ball, and late swing beats his edge as he looks to play the forward defensive

Pandya to Fernando, OUT, gone, and Hardik Pandya's slower-ball bouncer continues to take wickets. It's angling into the batsman, cramping him for room, and gets up to shoulder height. Looks to lean away and ramp it towards third man, but it keeps following him, and when the edge is taken, it's very close to the shoulder of the bat. The ball dies on its way through to Dhoni, who takes another very good catch, tumbling to his left and taking it inches off the ground

Ends up slicing it instead for a simple catch to Jadeja taking a couple of backward steps at backward point

Jadeja to Mathews, no run, appeal for a stumping - did Mathews lift his foot? This is that most difficult Jadeja ball to face, the flat, quick one that spins sharply. Gets forward to defend but the ball pitches shorter than expected, making him reach for it, and rips past his outside edge. Dhoni, as always, is electric with the glovework. Grandhommehere was Mathews' foot? Is it on the line, or is some part of it grounded behind it? There appears to be just a bit of bat grounded behind the crease, and the third umpire flashes the not-out sign on the big screen

Jadeja to Mathews, SIX runs, wow. That wasn't the cleanest of strikes. Flat one angling into the stumps, and he clears his front leg for the swipe over long-on. Hits the outside half of the bat, close to the leading edge, but it still carries all the way

Ganesh : "India have been brilliant in this tournament and their loss to England was mainly because of their error in strategy. On such a small ground we went with two spinners contrary to England who played with five fast bowlers. Kuldeep and Chahal went for 170 odd runs in 20 overs. Not only they were expensive also they released the pressure created by the fast bowlers. Also toss is becoming crucial and has a huge impact on the results. Bat first and take advantage of the slow surface."

Pandya continues from round the wicket.
Pandya to Mathews, FOUR runs, shot! That's short on off stump, only gets up to chest height, and Mathews knows square leg is in the circle. Goes for placement rather than power on this checked pull, just beats the fielder to his right

Thanks, Andrew. Your phrasing of "middle overs" reminds me of the old days - which most of you kids tuning in won't remember - of 15-over field restrictions. Can Sri Lanka summon up the spirit of the 90s and summon up a wicket now, with some choking spin bowling backed up by incredibly vigilant fielders at short extra-cover/short midwicket? For now it's Thisara Perera's rumbling seam.

The bad part is it is the same line and length that he thrashed for four now he struggles with. Clearly he does not know his own strengths and weakness." -- The easing of the field restrictions could be the reason for this. Or pitches that have had the tendency of slowing down.

For England, they will expect to have to beat both India and Australia, so India at Edgbaston and Australia at Lord's is probably less favourable than Australia at Edgbaston and India at Lord's!
