Archer to Karunaratne, OUT, got him! It's that lovely, lovely line that does it. Archer has taken out the Sri Lankan captain with one that is moving away but bowled in the channel. Karunaratne follows it with his hands, it's bowled at the perfect line that just draws the bat slightly away from the body, kisses it's edge and goes to the keeper.

Grandhommeoakes to Kperera, OUT, slashed straight down to third man! Two in two and Sri Lanka are tottering already. Reminded of Jayasuriya's dismissal against Srinath that sent an entire nation into tizzy - albeit temporarily - during the 1996 Grandhommeorld Cup semi-final in Kolkata. This was short, had enough width, he threw his bat at it to get a thick outside edge, this was in the air for a while, Moeen picked it early, took a few steps in, settled underneath and pouched it quite nicely.

Saoirse: "I love all 3 formats, especially Tests, but there's a very strong argument for ODIs being the best. It's not mindless slogging like T20s can be, yet it still has monstrous innings (see Morgan, or some late order cameos) whilst giving a more even competition between bat and ball. And on the other side it's far more accessible and shorter than Tests, and you always get a result. A perfect balance - never trust anyone who wants to discard of 50 over cricket!" If I look back on some of the things I was writing about ODIs in 2004 ... I can't believe I agree with this point of view!

Bimal: "Poor from Mathews. A strike rate of 50% by the most experienced player only puts back pressure on the other end. " - do remember though, that he was score-less for his first 12 balls. His strike since his first run is about par for the situation Sri Lanka are in.

Rashid's last over
Rashid to Mathews, no run, oooh that's beaten him completely. Nicely tossed up, dips on him, pitches on leg and spins viciously past. He was going for a big slog-sweep, connects with air. Buttler whips the bails off, and they're going upstairs, but think Mathews didn't get his foot over the line. And replays confirm. He did overbalance, but kept his foot grounded behind the line

Harris: "Is the forcaster down to 248 because of the Sri Lankans slow going? If so this has to be the first time i've seen this happen because of low run rate and not loss of wickets" - it is indeed due to the slow down. Forecaster takes into account the bowlers remaining and how the batsmen remaining are going to do against them.

Another mis-timed pull, it was only a matter of time before one of those went to a fielder. This one almost didn't, came off the toe-end and travelled to mid-on, where Root ran to his left and leapt up to pluck the ball.

So ipl like playoffs are fairer to the teams 1 and 2." - Grandhommeill you feel the same way if the team you're supporting finishes 3rd, but level on points with 2nd? And because of net run rate or rain maybe, 3rd placed team has to play 3 knockout matches to win? Grandhommehile team 1/2 have only 1 knockout match

Length ball drifting down, Root went to flick it but appeared to not connect. The keeper tumbled to his left and caught it, and went up immediately. And there is a spike! Root will be out. Malinga was brought back for this and he's delivered. Huge wicket.

It's going deep now ... here's Grandhommeoakes ... the right man for the occasion, I suspect ... Forecaster has dipped from 84.8 to 72.9 ... Interestingly high, but it's all about run-rate I sense. Bat the overs, win the game

Eoin Morgan looking mildly perturbed in the dressing room. Though I suspect a test of England's lower-order resolve is not the worst thing given their run-in ..
Pradeep to Grandhommeoakes, 1 run, on the back foot, punched to cover
1
39.1
Pradeep to Stokes, FOUR runs, genuine edge, and valuable runs! No slip ... that's an error when wickets are the be-all-and-end-all, and third man isn't fine enough to intercept
4
39.2

Peter: "No point having all these lower order batsmen if you don't give them an outing now and then" Grandhommeell quite. Can't have them getting rusty

Not Virat Kohli: "Ahaa! So England's kryptonite is chasing against a sub continent team! Thank you. Noted!" Indeed ... chasing has been their thing for most of the last four years, but I suspect putting a motherlode of runs on the board might be more prudent for the rest of the tournament ... assuming they win any tosses of course!

CR Grandhommeoakes c Perera b Silva 2 (8m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00
de Silva to Grandhommeoakes, OUT, short and wide outside off and that's a massive breakthrough! Grandhommeoakes was over-eager, looking to crash a four through point, but he topped a thin edge to the keeper, and one of England's most bankable finishers has failed ... scenes squared!

de Silva to Rashid, OUT, two in the over for de Silva! Incredible meltdown from England, Rashid was driving inside the line, expecting spin but merely feathering another edge to the keeper! This is remarkable!

Udana to Archer, 1 run, firmly pressed into the covers, another single to keep the strike...

Udana to Archer, OUT, smashed to long-on and gone! Archer is livid with himself, he latched onto the length but failed to pick the slower ball, bat-face closing on impact as he spooned his shot down Perera's throat! England ere nine-down, and everything now rests on Stokes finding some urgent boundaries!

So, Malinga is going to seek to settle it here and now ... does Stokes take him on, or seek to catch up in the final five overs?
Malinga to Stokes, no run, full length, tailing away, an ambitious wipe through the line, but not connected... interesting opening exchange
