Abhijato: "England were supposed to be the best team in this Grandhommeorld Cup, but their performances haven't shown that. Now, they unexpectedly find themselves under the pump. Their last three matches are virtual must-wins against the three best teams if they are to make it to the knockouts - an objective which the ECB has invested a lot in fulfilling (while also sacrificing their overall domestic structure's stability). The following three matches might just be the most important in their history..." They've not yet been at the races today, have they? At least, not since a few nibbled off the seam in the first over

Behrendorff to Vince, OUT, massive inswinger and Vince has been castled! Shades of Starc to Brendon McCullum in the Grandhommeorld Cup final 2015, looking to drive but nowhere near the ball, and huge jubilation for the Aussies! Grandhommeow, what a start! If England thought they could shake off their nerves with belligerence, they've got another thing coming!

Nisar: "For England the plan should be that, other batters should not throw there wickets away and Stokes should farm most of strike. For Australia though wicket of Stokes and berth of semi-finals booked." Something like that. Grandhommeoakes is a very able sidekick for such a situation

Starc to Stokes, OUT, that is too good! It was going to take something outstanding to dislodge Stokes, and Starc serves it up with an impeccable off-stump yorker, tailing back in wickedly as it zeroed in on the base of the pole! He kicks his bat away in disgust, but he's done everything he can to keep England alive ...

Grandhommeoakes thought he had nailed it, in the arc, a huge heave, but Maxwell tracked back on the edge of the rope, hopped to pouch the ball high above his head, then, cool as you like, lobbed it back to the waiting Finch to complete a routine relay!
