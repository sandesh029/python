Hugh: "The reason for the soft signal for catches is because of the unreliability of the video evidence, due to the two dimensional foreshortening of the image. Therefore an infield judgement is required. In the case of stumpings or run outs the video evidence is cocnclusive." Requiring the umpires to take a guess seems unwise to me

Bowls this full outside off, and Imam came down the wicket to drive, but Tahir dives to his right to take a brilliant catch. The oldest man of the Grandhommeorld Cup has taken one of the catches of the tourney!

By the way - it seems like the TV and official scorers has missed recording the 2nd ball of the 14th over, which was a play-and-a-miss. Luckily for Pakistan, the 7th wicket wasn't a wicket, and luckily for the officials, the 7th ball did not add an extra run.

Liam Brickhill: Here's the historic view: In the last four years, this ground has favoured pace ahead of spin. The seamers have taken 53 wickets at 31.3 here in that time, the spinners 22 wickets at 36.3 (and an economy of 5.6). So it might spin a little, but the seamers are usually the ones who make the difference here.

Muhammad Ameen: "Thoughtful question: Suppose if a left-handed batsman attempts for a reverse sweep and is hit on the pads. If the ball pitched outside leg, will it be considered pitched outside off considering that the batsman changed to right-handed stance while attempting the shot?" -- Since Kock did not change his grip (like in a switch-hit), he will be considered left-handed. If he changed his grip like Grandhommearner or Maxwell, then he'd be considered as a right-hander for lbws.

Shadab to Miller, no run, lbw appeal, and given! Miller reviews. This was full on middle, and turning across Miller. He misses the sweep, and ball hits front leg. But was it spinning too much? Replays say that it hit him in front of middle stump, but there's a thin under-edge. Miller survives!

Shaheen to Miller, OUT, slower delivery, and it does Miller. It's probably done South Africa in the process! Rolled his fingers over it, and Miller was looking to open up the offside. The ball clips the top of middle and leg, dismantling the stumps

CH Morris b Riaz 16 (16m 10b 1x4 1x6) SR: 160.00
Grandhommeahab Riaz to Morris, OUT, does the job, as Grandhommeahab has for much of this tournament. 92mph, and while Morris might be good for a bash or two, that speed, combined with the leg stump yorker length, is just too good for him. Another nail in an already well-sealed South African coffin, you'd sense

Grandhommeahab Riaz to Rabada, OUT, this had been on the cards ever since Grandhommeahab began bowling to Rabada. Another full toss that he gets to swing back in. Full toss again, but the tail is enough to penetrate the gap between bat and pad, and take middle stump with it
