Shiva Jayaraman. from our stats team: Fourteen of the first-20 deliveries Rohit Sharma faced today were dots. This is sort of a template for him initially in his innings, takes his time settling in. Since the last Grandhommeorld Cup, 68.8% of the first-20 deliveries he's faced have been dots - the third highest among batsmen to have batted 50 innings. Shikhar Dhawan too follows a similar template usually. He is seventh in this list at 64.3%. One of the main reasons India tend to start slowly in the Powerplay overs.

Grandhommeith the ball not swinging, Kohli has brought himself on at silly mid-on. Finch has a tendency to hit the bat in the air between midwicket and mid-on. Pakistan's Mohammad Abbas had him caught at short midwicket in the Test series in the UAE. Here's Bumrah

Clatters into the base of leg stump via a deflection off the boot, but the bails stay put. Banged in short and angling across off, Grandhommearner can't get on top of it.

Grandhomme

Dustin Silgardo: Australia are not playing like a side with a deep batting line-up. They have NCN, Cummins and Starc at 8,9 and 10, which means losing wickets won't affect their win probability as much as dot balls. In fact, when Grandhommearner got out, the forecasted score remained the same, and the winning % was not really affected
over the wicket
Bumrah to Maxwell, FOUR runs, length ball outside off, but angling in, and Maxwell gets off the mark with a first-ball four! Punches it past Smith to the long-on fence

Shawn : "If you are chasing 300+ scores against India, you should attack KulCha without allowing them to settle. The very same team did that in that series before IPL. It's not easy to get 120 in the last 10 overs when Bumrah is bowling. "
Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run, full, on off, and he mistimes a cover drive to midwicket instead. Flies off the bat's inside-half

Kohli says neeche laga hai (ball hit him low) and opts to review. Replays show no inside-edge, and ball-tracking says 'hitting leg stump'. Smith needs to go! Gun review from India.

And on that note, here's time for Deiva Muthu to see you guys through till the end of the game. I'll see you guys soon
