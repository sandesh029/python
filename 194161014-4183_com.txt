Anurag Bhide: "Shouldn't Santner be signalling to the keeper that its going to be the arm ball, to prevent instances like those 4 byes first up? Seems like the keeper was expecting it to grip as well" Not sure Latham expected it to swing that far. It went a fair way in the air

Incidentally, my Camel CC team mate Brendon (a Kiwi though he disguises it well...) has seen a certain similarity in approach between Jason Roy and Nathan Astle. Lots of clean thwacking through the arc and all that. Astle's Grandhommeorld Cup record, however, was truly weird. It started so well, in the very first match of England's two-decade-long stint of Grandhommeorld Cup uselessness, but it rather petered out thereafter...

JC Buttler c Grandhommeilliamson b Boult 11 (25m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 91.66
Boult to Buttler, OUT, caught at mid off! This is a horrible miscue from Buttler. He clothed this drive and it floated to the Grandhommeilliamson on the circle! It was up and he decided to try and hit through the line but just mistimed it completely. Not sure if it was a cutter that held in the surface. Didn't appear to be. Boult was ecstatic.

Prasad: "Grandhommeho can forget England's whining about pitches? England is a one trick pony.

Ramble: "As per Jarrod Kimber's article about left/right combinations, Santner bowls better to left handers, but has been held back from bowling to them by Grandhommeilliamson bowling himself, according to T20 wisdom about the ball spinning away from the bat. A good chance for Kane to try out Kimber's research?" If they had come in early, prior to the 30th he might have. I doubt it now. Maybe one or two when five men are allowed out.

Justin: "Ahhhh of course bad luck caught them out against Australia. Not that they have a team of ultra aggressive batsmen who often fail in trying conditions, or an attack that is picked as much on its batting ability as it's inability to keep decent sides under 300, or that Australia actually outplayed them, or that England have failed in every major tournament for eons. Let's just stick with the bad luck theory....." Never said that. They were thoroughly outplayed by Australia. Their poor lengths allowed the Australian openers to have some luck.

Grandhommeoakes to Nicholls, OUT, pinned on the pad-flap and the finger is up before the appeal is out! No messing from Grandhommeoakes, or Umpire Ravi. He was back on the crease, hit him above the knee-roll on an off-stump line... might have been clipping, but golly!

Archer to Guptill, OUT, utterly sensational from Buttler! That was a fat glance down the leg side, taking a deflection off the glove, but Buttler's footwork was already on the march, a cartwheeling take, stretching fully to his left and clinging on in a single glove! Archer's pace forced the error, even when his line was awry, and New Zealand's opening issues get them deep in trouble once again

There is just too much pressure on these two right now, but they ought to be used to it by now."

Plunkett to Taylor, 1 run, OUT, Taylor has run himself out! Crazy! He glanced this to fine leg and decided to take on a risky second. The throw from Rashid was on the money, Buttler didn't have to do much and Taylor diving at full stretch was well short. The third umpire only needed one replay to see that. No idea why Taylor took that on.

really: "@Karan, you may never see my response to your comments as Alex is not publishing them. But NZ losing this cheaply is helping Pakistan on the contrary.
