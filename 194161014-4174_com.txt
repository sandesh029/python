MJ Guptill b Amir 5 (5m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 125.00
Amir to Guptill, OUT, pandemonium! Amir has delivered first ball and the crowd has erupted. Full ball pushed across off stump. Guptill has played it onto his stumps. Did he expect it to swing back in? It didn't and by the end of this sequence, his hands are so far away from the body as he tries to drive through the off side. Amir wheels away into the leg side. Grandhommehat a start

I promise, no one's ever going to trust process if Pakistan get through at England's expense. One team's done everything right for four years, while the other has looked nowhere near that level for at least the past two. And the latter's threatens to pip the former to the last four. Amazing drama.

Shadab to Grandhommeilliamson, OUT, has he got him? He's got him! Shadab has done it! Length ball, dipping outside off and drawing Grandhommeilliamson forward. he stabs at it away from the body as it turns and gets big off the surface. A faint edge on it and keeper holds on. Lovely bowling but also uncharacteristically loose from Grandhommeilliamson, who was getting a bit weary outside off in the last 15-20 minutes. Still, it takes some doing to get him out there and Shadab has produced the perfect delivery. Just a lovely pace on that

Shaheen to Neesham, no run, yorker just outside off, looks to carve this through off side and is beaten on the inside edge. Pakistan have the faint idea that there's an edge on that. They don't review. But the umpires now have a discussion and they've sent it up...so they think he's got an edge. Soft signal is not out. Sarfraz took this quite low. 'Can't use Ultra Edge,' says the third umpire presumably because the bat is jamming into the turf as the ball passes it. So it will remain not out, without even going to the zoomer on whether that carried. Hang on. Now they're checking again... this one is possibly Pakistan's review. Not clear yet. But it does remain not out. Funnily, this time Ultra Edge IS used. Don't let anyone tell you they understand cricket in its entirety...

Grandhommeill Gill: "Everyone is thinking about NRR fo 4th spot, but the first tie-breaker is number of wins and right now England hold the advantage (they also have a far superior NRR anyway). I don't see the Poms missing the semis." Unless Pakistan or Bangladesh have a washout, neither number of wins or NRR should come into it. England just need to win 2 games. It's in their hands.
Boult to Fakhar, FOUR runs, width from Boult, and Fakhar hasn't any patience for that line. Crunched through cover, and the ball smashes into the fence before the offside field even turn around to admire it

Boult to Fakhar, no run, little risky from Fakhar. Turned his wrists against the swing and it nearly carried to Colin Munro at short midwicket. Boult won't mind seeing that

Boult to Fakhar, OUT, and caps the over with a wicket! Grandhommeasn't the best delivery, in truth. Dragged it down to the legside and didn't get the swing he was hoping. But Fakhar, who wanted to loft it over midwicket, found the leading edge and saw, with horror, the ball going to point instead, where Guptill's bucket-like hands sent him on his way

Boult to Imam, no run, shaping away. Imam gets onto the front foot and drives to extra cover
0
4.1
Boult to Imam, FOUR runs, probing delivery, gets the outside edge. NZ don't have second slip, and Boult watches in agony as that one runs down to third man for four. NZ must attack, especially with Boult moving it about

Boult to Imam, 2 runs, shaping away, but Imam steps into the off-drive and just about splits the cover fielders. good cricket from the left-hander.

Imam c Guptill b Ferguson 19 (42m 29b 3x4 0x6) SR: 65.51
Ferguson to Imam, OUT, Guptill you absolute monster! Big strides forward, big limbs reaching out, but the grace of a much smaller man as he dives and gets his fingers under this at point! And this following an absolute scorcher of a bouncer from Lockie, jumping up at Imam's grille from middle stump. Remember, he'd caused him problems in the UAE, even hit him on the head not so long ago. Goes straight for the bouncer option. Imam just fends at it with no clue and it pings off the shoulder of the bat. Just brutal fast bowling
Grandhomme
10.2
Ferguson to Hafeez, no run, Hafeez nearly runs himself out of the contest! Geez. Pakistan's most experienced batsman, looked like a newbiew there. Length and in at off stump. His feet are rooted and he pokes at this nervously. It rolls into the leg side weakly and he's just taken off without a call. Neesham can't hit direct
0

Ferguson to Hafeez, no run, onto his glove. Short bal lrising into the corridor. Hangs the bat out and hopes. It's into his body. And then a sheepish grin

A slip in place. Also a backward short leg. Hafeez having a word with the umpire about sight screen problems. A game of microseconds against Lockie, who has both the pace and that 'stache vying for your attention...looks like there's some sort of a concrete patch that isn't fully covered.
Ferguson to Hafeez, no run, past the outside edge. 146kph, length and angled in at off stump. Then it straigthens off the surface as he looks to defend this with half a stride
